<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> narrative of prison life differs from all
others that I have seen, in that it is careful to put
the best possible construction upon the treatment
of Union prisoners by the Confederates, and
to state and emphasize kindnesses and courtesies
received by us from them.</p>

<p>For the accuracy of the facts stated I am
indebted to a diary kept from day to day during
the whole of my imprisonment, and to the best
obtainable records. The exact language of conversations
cannot of course always be remembered,
but I aim always to give correctly the substance.</p>

<p>I am aware that the opinions I express in regard
to Sheridan's strategy at the Battle of Winchester
are not those generally entertained. But I give
reasons. His own account of the battle is sadly
imperfect. To capture but five guns and nine
battle flags at a cost of four thousand six hundred
and eighty killed and wounded, and leave almost
the entire rebel army in shape to fight two great
battles within a month, was not the programme
he had planned. Early said "Sheridan should
have been cashiered."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall be blamed more for venturing to question
Lincoln's policy of subjugation. He had proclaimed
with great power and in the most unmistakable
language in Congress that "any portion of
any people had a perfect right to throw off their
old government and establish a new one." But
now, instead of standing strictly on the defensive,
or attempting by diplomacy to settle the
conflict which had become virtually international,
he entered upon a war of conquest.</p>

<p>I do not blame him for refusing to exchange
prisoners, nor President Davis for allowing them to
starve and freeze. Both were right, <i>if war is right</i>.
It was expedient that thirty, fifty, or a hundred
thousand of us should perish, or be rendered
physically incapable of bearing arms again. The
"deep damnation of the taking off" was due not
to individual depravity but to military necessity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>The First, or Forenoon, Battle of Winchester, Indecisive&mdash;Sheridan's
and Early's Mistakes&mdash;The Capture.</p></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">War is Hell</span>," said our great strategist,
General W. T. Sherman. According to its latest
code, with few or no exceptions, the end justifies
the means, and, if necessary to success, it is right
to do wrong.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago one of the fairest regions on
earth was that portion of Virginia extending southwesterly
about a hundred and twenty miles from
Harper's Ferry to the divide beyond Staunton,
where rise the headwaters of the James. Walled
in by the Blue Ridge on the southeast and parallel
ranges of the Alleghanies on the northwest, it
takes its name from the beautiful river which
winds along its length, and which the Indians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
poetically christened Shenandoah (Daughter of
the Stars!). When some three hundred of us
prisoners of war walked wearily a hundred miles
from Winchester to Staunton in September, 1864,
it was still rich and lovely. A few weeks later,
the necessities of war made it a scene of utter
desolation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">Grant had rightly concluded [says Sheridan<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>],
that it was time to bring the war home to a people
engaged in raising crops from a prolific soil to feed the
country's enemies, and devoting to the Confederacy
its best youth. I endorsed the program in all its
parts; for the stores of meat and grain that the valley
provided, and the men it furnished for Lee's
depleted regiments, were the strongest auxiliaries
he possessed.</p></div>

<p class="noin">Accordingly Grant issued orders with increasing
emphasis, particularly in August and September,
to make the whole region "a barren waste," to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>destroy or carry off the crops and animals; do all
possible damage to railroads; seize stock of every
description; take away all negro laborers so as to
prevent further planting; hold as prisoners of war, if
sympathizing with the rebellion, all male citizens
under fifty years of age capable of bearing arms, etc.</p></div>

<p>In obedience to these commands, Sheridan
engaged with alacrity in the work of destruction.
In a few weeks he reported as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">I have destroyed 2000 barns filled with wheat, hay,
and farming implements; over 70 mills filled with
flour and wheat; and driven in front of my army 4000
head of stock.</p></div>

<p>Said one of his officers who knew whereof he was
speaking, "A crow flying through the valley would
have to carry his own rations, for he could pick
up nothing!"</p>

<p>At Winchester, the principal town in the
Shenandoah Valley, one hundred and fifty miles
N. N. W. of Richmond, with a population of about
four thousand, the 19th of that September was a
day of glory but also of sorrow. Four thousand
six hundred and eighty of the Union Army, killed
and wounded, told how dearly Sheridan's first
great victory was gained.</p>

<p>The battle was fought over three, four, or five
square miles, east and north from Winchester,
for the most part near the Opequon Creek, from
which it is sometimes called the "Battle of the
Opequon." To reach the field, the bulk of
Sheridan's army, starting at three o'clock in the
morning from Berryville ten miles east, had to
pass through a gorge in which for a considerable
distance the turnpike extends towards Winchester.
Sheridan's plan at first was to bring his army,
except Merritt's and Averell's Divisions of Torbert's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Cavalry, through the defile, post the Sixth
Corps on the left, the Nineteenth on the right,
throw Crook's Army of West Virginia across the
Staunton turnpike (leading southwest from Winchester),
and so cut off all retreat up the valley.
Meanwhile those two cavalry divisions were to
make a long detour on our right to the north from
Berryville, and close in upon the Confederate left.
Sheridan felt sure of victory, for we outnumbered
the enemy nearly two to one. Had our army got
into position early in the morning, we should have
captured or destroyed the whole of them.</p>

<p>At early dawn McIntosh's Brigade of Wilson's
Division of Torbert's Cavalry dashed through the
ravine, closely followed by Chapman's Brigade
and five batteries of horse artillery. Sheridan and
his staff followed. They surprised and captured
a small earthwork, and, though fiercely assaulted,
held it till the van of the Sixth Corps relieved them.</p>

<p>The narrow pass of the Berryville pike was so
obstructed by artillery, ambulances, ammunition
wagons, etc., that it was nearly eight o'clock before
the Sixth Corps, which should have been in position
with Wilson's Cavalry at sunrise, began to
arrive; and it was fully two hours later when the
Nineteenth Corps debouched and deployed. Here
was miscalculation or bad management or both.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>This long delay, which the quick-moving cavalry
leader Sheridan had not foreseen nor provided for,
gave time for Early to call in the strong divisions
of Generals Gordon, Breckenridge, and Rodes,
from the vicinity of Stephenson's Depot several
miles away. They left Patton's Brigade of Infantry,
and a part of Fitzhugh Lee's Cavalry to
oppose Torbert.</p>

<p>Hearing nothing from Torbert, who had now
been gone seven or eight hours on his circuitous
route, Sheridan suddenly changed his whole plan
of action, a perilous maneuver in the face of an
active enemy while the battle is already raging
intermittently. Instead of flinging Crook's Army
of West Virginia, 17 regiments and 3 batteries,
across the Staunton pike, to front northeasterly
and cut off all possible retreat of the Confederates,
he determined to move it to our right and deploy
it in line with the Nineteenth. Doubtless this
was best under the circumstances, though it left
to the enemy the broad smooth highway as a line
of retreat up the valley.</p>

<p>Grover's Division (2d of the Nineteenth Corps)
in four brigades formed line of battle in front and
to the right of the gorge. In touch on the left
was Ricketts' Division of the Sixth Corps, and
resting on Ricketts' left was Getty's Division of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the same corps. Getty had 16 regiments in line;
Ricketts, 12 with 6 batteries; Grover, 20 with 3
batteries.</p>

<p>Had Sheridan been able to strike Early by half-past
eight with the Sixth and Nineteenth, he would
have crushed him in detail. Had Early massed
the divisions of Gordon, Breckenridge, and Rodes,
and hurled them at the mouth of the canyon at
ten o'clock while half of the Nineteenth was still
entangled in it, he would probably have split our
army into three parts, and destroyed those already
arrived.</p>

<p>It was now eleven o'clock, and the Army of
West Virginia at last emerged from the defile.
To make room for its movement in our rear behind
Grover's Division, and to hold the enemy in play
until it should have taken its place on the right of
the Nineteenth, and perhaps to await there the
appearance of Torbert's Cavalry, it was desirable
that Grover should advance. Sheridan of course
meant the whole front of the Sixth and Nineteenth
to keep in a continuous line. At first it seemed to
me that the regiments of the Nineteenth overlapped;
but the lines of advance were slightly
divergent, and wide breaks began to appear
between battalions. Especially on the left of the
Nineteenth a large and widening gap appeared; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Ricketts had been instructed to guide on the
Berryville pike, and that bore away to the left
and south.</p>

<p>My battalion, the veteran Thirteenth Conn.
Infantry, should have been led by my Colonel,
C. D. Blinn: but he was sick the night before, and
in the morning, at the crossing of the Opequon, he
fell out, and left the command to me. He had
no part in the battle. Our Thirteenth deserves a
passing notice. It was the favorite regiment of
General Birge, its first colonel.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> When he was
made brigadier, the regiment entered the brigade
commanded by Colonel E. L. Molineux. Birge
was never so happy as when riding into action,
and Molineux, who had been severely wounded
in the same battle with me, was not over-cautious.
My regiment and both brigades, the first and
second of Grover's Division, had caught the spirit
of those two commanders. Quite generally they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
mistook the forward movement for an immediate
charge.</p>

<p>We had been under an intermittent fire for some
time, but now the advance intensified the conflict.
The chief anxiety of good soldiers at such a time,
as I often noticed, is to get at the enemy as soon
as possible, and cease to be mere targets. Their
enthusiasm now accelerated their pace to a double-quick,
and was carrying them too far to the front.
Birge and Molineux endeavored in vain to check
their rapidity. My battalion, I think, was nearest
the rebel line.</p>

<p>Between eleven and twelve the divisions of
Getty, Ricketts, and Grover, forty-eight regiments
in all, to which were attached eight light batteries
with reserve artillery, began to move forward.
It was a grand spectacle. At first the movement
was steady, and we thought of Scott's lines,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The host moves like a deep-sea wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High-swelling, dark, and slow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">But all is quickly changed.</p>

<p>Looking back upon that scene after the lapse of
more than fifty years, its magnificence has not yet
faded. I see as in a dream our long bending wave
of blue rolling slowly at first but with increasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
speed, foam-tipped with flags here and there
and steel-crested with Birge's bayonets yonder;
glimpses of cavalry in the distance moving as if on
wings with the lightness of innumerable twinkling
feet; numberless jets of smoke across the fields
marking the first line of Confederate infantry,
their musketry rattling precisely like exploding
bunches of firecrackers; batteries galloping to
position, the thunder of a dozen smiting the ear
more rapidly than one could count; the buzz, hiss,
whistle, shriek, crash, hurricane of projectiles; the
big shot from batteries in front and from Braxton's
artillery on our right ripping up the ground and
bounding away to the rear and the left; horses
and riders disappearing in the smoke of exploding
shells; the constant shouting of our officers indistinctly
heard, and now and then the peculiar
well-known "rebel yell"; and finally the command,
<span class="smcapl">HALT! LIE DOWN!</span> Molineux and Birge were
too far to the front, and the line must be rectified.
Ricketts, as we pressed forward, had thrown
Keifer's Brigade (2d of Third Division, Sixth
Corps), seven regiments, into the broadening interval
directly in front of the mouth of the gorge;
but it was not sufficient.</p>

<p>It was now Early's opportunity; but he was
hours too late, just as Sheridan had been. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
had seen our Sixth Corps and Nineteenth emerge
and deploy, had beheld our rapid and somewhat
disorderly approach, had noted the widening
spaces between our battalions and divisions, had
observed the havoc wrought by his artillery and
musketry, ten thousand of our soldiers seeming to
sink under it; had had time to mass his forces;
and now it was "up to him" to hurl them against
our centre. It was the strategy inaugurated by
Epaminondas at Leuctra and perfected by Napoleon
in many a hard battle, breaking the enemy's
centre by an irresistible charge, dividing and
conquering. Rodes had been killed at a battery in
front of our brigade. His veterans and Gordon's,
six thousand strong<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> constituted the charging column.
Neither Sheridan nor any other Federal historian
appears to have done justice to this charge.
Pickett's at Gettysburg was not more brilliant.</p>

<p>With yells distinctly heard above the roar they
advanced. The batteries on each side redoubled
their discharges. From our irregular line of
infantry extending more than a mile blazed incessant
sheets and spurts of flame, the smoke at times
hiding the combatants. Gordon was heading
toward the now nearly empty ravine. My horse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had just been shot under me. I lost two in that
fight. Dismounted I walked from the right of my
battalion to the left, cautioning my men against
wasting their ammunition, bidding them take
sure aim, pick out the rebel officers, and not fire
too high. They were shooting from a recumbent
position, or resting on one knee; lying flat on their
backs to reload. As I reached the left, I glanced to
the right and saw several of them starting to their
feet, and a little further on, two or three began
to run back. I rushed to the spot shouting,
"Back to your places!" I saw the cause: the
regiments on our right were retreating. I was
astounded, for we were expecting an order to
advance instantly. At that moment Lieutenant
Handy, an aide of our brigade commander,
rode up, pale, excited, his hands flung up as if in
despair. My men were springing to their feet.</p>

<p>"What are those orders?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Retreat, retreat! get to the rear as fast as
possible," he replied.</p>

<p>"Battalion, rise up; shoulder arms&mdash;" I commanded.
Before I could finish the order, one of
Sheridan's staff came on a swift gallop, his horse
white with foam.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, what does this mean?" said
he; "this retreat must be stopped!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Battalion, lie down," I shouted; "our brigade
commander ordered retreat!"</p>

<p>"It's all wrong. If this position's lost, all's lost.
Here you have some cover. Hold it to the last.
I'll bring supports immediately." Striking spurs
into his steed, he vanished in the direction of the
retreating regiments.</p>

<p>Except the few who had heard my command
and remained in position, perhaps seventy-five
or a hundred, who kept blazing away at the Confederates,
rising a little to kneel and fire, Grover's
Division, and all we could see of that of Ricketts,
had gone to pieces, swept away like chaff before a
whirlwind. Not a Union flag now in sight, but
plenty of the "Stars and Bars!" Our sputtering
fire checked some directly in front; but most of
the on-rushing masses were deflected by the nature
of the ground.</p>

<p>Out of our view and about half a mile in our
rear was Dwight's Division, the First of the
Nineteenth Corps. It had been left in reserve.
It was in line of battle and ready for the onset.
The confused fragments of Grover were rallied
behind it. Had the ground been favorable, and
had no unexpected opposition been encountered,
Gordon would have crushed Dwight.</p>

<p>But in fewer minutes than we have occupied in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
describing this charge, a tremendous and prolonged
roar and rattle told us that the battle was on
behind us more than in front. Amid the din
arose a quick succession of deafening crashes,
and shot and shell came singing and howling over
us from the left. Russell's Division (First of the
Sixth Corps) comprising eleven infantry regiments
and one of heavy artillery, behind which the broken
battalions of Ricketts had been reassembling,
was now smiting the right flank of Gordon's six
thousand. Although the charge came too late
we cannot but admire the strategy that directed
it, and the bravery of the infantry of Gordon,
Rodes, and Ramseur, as well as that of the cavalry
of Lomax, Jackson, and Johnson, and of Fitzhugh
Lee who fell severely wounded. But they had not
foreseen the terrible cross-fire from Russell, who
died at the head of his division, a bullet piercing
his breast and a piece of shell tearing through his
heart. Nor had they calculated on confronting
the long line of Dwight, nine regiments with the
Fifth New York Battery, all of which stood like a
stone breakwater. Against it Gordon's masses,
broken by the irregularities of the ground, dashed
in vain. Under the ceaseless fire of iron and lead
the refluent waves came pouring back. Our army
was saved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>But we few, who, in obedience to explicit orders
from headquarters, had held our position stiffly
farthest to the front when all the rest of Grover's
and Ricketts' thousands had retreated&mdash;we were
lost. A column behind a rebel flag was advancing
straight upon us unchecked by our vigorous fire.
Seeing that they meant business, I commanded,
"Fix Bayonets!" At that instant the gray surges
converged upon us right and left and especially
in our rear. We seemed in the middle of the
rebel army. In the crater of such a volcano, fine-spun
theories, poetic resolves to die rather than be
captured&mdash;these are point-lace in a furnace. A
Union officer, Capt. W. Frank Tiemann of the
159th N. Y., Molineux's Brigade, was showing
fight, and half a dozen Confederates with clubbed
muskets were rushing upon him. I leaped to the
spot, sword in hand, and shouted with all the semblance
I could assume of fierce authority,</p>

<p>"Down with those muskets! Stop! I command
you." They lowered them.</p>

<p>"Who the hell are you?" they asked.</p>

<p>"I'll let you know." Turning instantly to four
or five Confederate officers, I demanded: "Do you
mean to massacre my men?"</p>

<p>Two or three replied: "No. By G&mdash;! You've
shown yourselves brave, and you shall be respected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Yes, you fought d&mdash;d well, seein' you had
the d&mdash;dest brigade to fight against in the whole
Confederate Army."</p>

<p>"What brigade are you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ramseur's old brigade; and there's nothin'
this side o' hell can lick it."</p>

<p>"You're brave enough," said another; "but
damn you, you've killed our best general."</p>

<p>"Who's that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Rodes; killed right in front of you."</p>

<p>"I thought Early was your best General."</p>

<p>"Not by a d&mdash; sight. Old Jubal's drunk&mdash;drunk
as a fool."</p>

<p>I was never more highly complimented than at
this moment; but the stunning consciousness of
being a prisoner, the bitterest experience of my
life, the unspeakable disappointment, the intense
mortification&mdash;these are even to this day poorly
mitigated, much less compensated, by the excessive
praises heaped upon me by those Confederate
officers for my supposed bravery. That they
were sincere I cannot doubt; for it was customary
on the battle-field for the rebels to strip prisoners
of all valuables, but no one of the fifty or one
hundred near me was robbed. Tiemann, whose
life I had perhaps saved, was even privileged to
keep his canteen of whiskey, of which he gave me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a drink by and by to keep me in good spirits! I
realized the truth of Burns's lines:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>At Winchester&mdash;On the Road thence to Tom's Brook, New
Market, and Staunton.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were two battles that Monday between
Sheridan and Early, the first indecisive, though
bloody, a drawn game; the second, after a comparative
lull of several hours, a fierce struggle in
which the whole front of the Sixth, Nineteenth,
and Crook's Corps simultaneously advanced, and
Torbert's Cavalry, arriving at last after their
unaccountable delay upon our extreme right, made
a magnificent charge crumpling up all the enemy's
left. The victory was real, but not so complete
as it should have been. Sheridan ought to have
captured or destroyed the whole of Early's army.
Instead, he had left them an open line of retreat.
He took only five pieces of artillery, nine
battle-flags, and some twelve or fifteen hundred
prisoners; and, to use his own words, "sent the
Confederates whirling up the valley."</p>

<p>In the recoil of Gordon's brilliant charge of six
thousand about noon, we prisoners were swept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
along into Winchester, and then locked in the old
Masonic Hall. The sociable guards took pains to
emphasize the statement that George Washington,
"glorious rebel" they called him, had presided
as Grand Master in that very room!</p>

<p>After several hours we heard a great noise in the
streets. Looking out we saw men, women, children,
moving rapidly hither and thither, the current for
the most part setting toward the southwest. The
din increased; the panic became general; the Union
Army was advancing on Winchester!</p>

<p>We were hustled into the street now filled with
retreating hundreds, and were marched rapidly
along the turnpike toward the setting sun. The
road crowded with artillery, army wagons, common
carriages, all pouring along in the stampede;
a formidable provost guard enclosing us prisoners
in a sort of hollow column; cavalry in front, flank,
and rear; the fields on either side swarming with
infantry, the whole of Early's army in retreat, we
apparently in the middle of it; Sheridan's guns
still booming in our rear&mdash;such was the scene as
we two or three hundred prisoners were driven
on. Our mingled emotions can be better imagined
than described. The bitter regret that we had
not been slain; the consciousness that we had
done our whole duty in facing unflinchingly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
storm of shot and shell, never retreating an inch;
the evident respect and even courtesy with which
I was personally treated; the inspiring certainty
that our army was victorious, the unspeakable
mortification of being ourselves prisoners of
war!&mdash;we sorely needed all our philosophy and all
our religion to sustain us.</p>

<p>Marching moodily along I was aroused from a
sort of reverie by an experience far too common
in those days. I had been sick the night before,
and had worn my overcoat into battle. My horse
was shot. The blood was spurting from him. As
he seemed likely to fall, I leaped down. We were
in the midst of a rapid advance and I had not time
to throw off my overcoat. I was now carrying
it swung over my arm. It was growing dark. A
mounted soldier, whom I took to be an officer,
rode up to my side and seized hold of the coat.
He said, "I want that overcoat." I replied,
"You can't have it." "I must have it." "You
shan't have it." He tugged and I tugged, and as
I was on foot and sober I nearly dragged him from
his horse before he let go. During the tussle I
repeatedly shouted, "Captain of the Guard&mdash;Help!
Help!" The provost captain instantly
came riding to the spot. "What's the matter?"
he asked. "That rascal has tried to rob me of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
overcoat," I answered, pointing to the villain
who was beginning to slink away. The captain
appeared to recognize him, said not a word to him,
but whispered to me a moment later, "You are
entitled to keep your overcoat."</p>

<p>We had had little breakfast and no dinner nor
supper, but we suffered more from thirst than
hunger. Can we ever forget it? Will the long
flight never end? On through Kerrstown without
halting we march, with promise of rest and water
at Newtown; no rest nor water there. On from
Newtown with assurance of water at Middletown.
Five minutes at Middletown, and a little muddy
water that seems to aggravate our thirst. Farther
on we cross a bridge under which the water
is dashing as if in mockery, and the cry "Water!
water!" rises from a hundred lips, the guard joining,
for they are suffering like ourselves. Some
comfort in that! Past midnight we reach Strasburg
and are halted around an old wooden pump.
It is broken! No water there. Still on and on at
a snail-pace, up and over the almost interminable
stretch of Fisher's Hill. At three o'clock in the
morning we arrive at a place known by the classical
name of Tom's Brook about twenty-five miles
from Winchester. Never was nectar more delicious
than the water of this stream, nor downy pillow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
more welcome than the sod on its banks. Without
blankets or covering we sank in each other's
arms for mutual warmth on the dew-drenched
grass; and blistered feet and aching limbs and
hunger and thirst and suffocating despair are all
forgotten!</p>

<p>Morning came unnoticed, except by those whom
the keen cold permitted to sleep no longer. Towards
noon we rose, washed without soap or towel,
were made to form line, had our names taken, and
received as rations a pint of flour per man, with a
little salt, nothing else. How to cook or prepare
the flour? We learned of the rebel guards a process
not laid down in the cook-books. Mixing
with water they made a stiff paste or dough.
This they put around the end of a stick about the
size and half the length of a walking cane. The
end thus thickly coated they hold over a little fire
till the smoke and flame have sufficiently hardened
it. Then pull out your stick and you have
a thick chunk or cylinder of bread, not quite so
tough as a gun-barrel, but substantial!</p>

<p>I contrived to keep a little memorandum book.
In it I noted down that there were three hundred
and eleven of us prisoners; two lieutenant-colonels,
two majors, four captains, nine lieutenants, and
two hundred and ninety-four enlisted men. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
were in the march from Winchester. A few may
have been added to our number at Tom's Brook.</p>

<p>I have stated how it happened that none of those
near me were robbed when captured. Those at a
distance were not so fortunate; for, if circumstances
permitted, the Confederates, being themselves
sadly in want, often improved the opportunity to
grab every article of value. At Tom's Brook I
noted in my diary the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">Major A. W. Wakefield, 49th Pa. Cav., was robbed
of hat, blanket, and $100 in money. Adjt. J. A.
Clark, 17th Pa. Cav., was robbed of cap, boots, mug,
pocket-book and money. Lieut. Harrison, 2d Regular
Cav., was robbed of gold watch and money. Capt.
John R. Rouzer, 6th Md. Inf., was robbed by an
officer of hat and $20 in money. Lieut. Wesley C.
Howe, 2d Mass. Cav., who recently died at Kansas
City, Mo., was robbed by Lieut. Housel of the 6th
Va. Cav., of silver watch, spurs, gloves, and $10 in
money. Major August Haurand, 4th N. Y. Cav.,
was robbed of a watch and $60 in money.</p></div>

<p>It was a common practice to snatch from a Union
prisoner his cap, and clap on in lieu of it a worn-out
slouched hat; pull off his boots, and substitute a
pair of clumsy old shoes. The plundering was so
thoroughly done that it was poetically termed
"going through" a captive!</p>

<p>As I was the senior officer among the prisoners,
and we seemed likely to remain a long time there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I went to the Confederate commander and besought
him to allow our three hundred prisoners
to occupy a barn near by. He refused. I then
asked that we be allowed to build wigwams for
shelter, as there was abundant material at hand.
This too was not permitted. I also begged in
vain that a surgeon should be got to dress the
wounds of some of the prisoners.</p>

<p>The second morning after our arrival, the sleeping
men were aroused by the loud voice of
Lieutenant Sargent of the 14th New Hampshire
Regiment exclaiming: "If you give me any more
of your lip, I'll annihilate you! I've but one
arm" (his right arm was disabled by a shot),
"but even with one arm I'll annihilate you on
the spot, if you give me any more of your lip!"
This was exceedingly gratifying, for it proved that
at least two of us were not yet "annihilated!"</p>

<p>During our sojourn at Tom's Brook the Confederates
labored hard to induce us to exchange our
greenbacks for their paper currency. Our own
was sadly depreciated, one dollar of silver or gold
being equal to two of greenbacks; but one in
United States paper was equal in purchasing power
to eight of theirs. They argued that our money
would certainly be forcibly taken from us by
rapacious guards farther south, and kindly offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
us four for one. Sergeant Reed of the Provost
Guard was quite a character. Like Gratiano
in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, he talked loud and long,
speaking "an infinite deal of nothing." He had a
mania for watches. He told me he now had
twenty-seven which he had obtained from Yankee
prisoners, always paying them in good Confederate
money. He set his heart upon a little silver watch
of mine, which he said he wished to buy and
present to one of his lady admirers. I asked:</p>

<p>"Why do they admire you?"</p>

<p>"Because of my bravery," he replied; "none
but the brave deserve the fair."</p>

<p>"If you are so brave, why are you back here?
Why are you not at the front?"</p>

<p>"Colonel, I've been in the forefront of the
hottest battles. I've been fearfully wounded.
I'll be hanged if I haven't been one of the bravest
of the brave. Twice, Colonel, I was shot all into
inch pieces; and so now I'm put on light duty!"</p>

<p>On Thursday, the third day after our arrival,
two "india-rubber men," circus performers, of the
22d Indiana Regiment, gave an exhibition of
"ground and lofty tumbling" for the entertainment
of their fellow prisoners. They had somehow
contrived to retain the gaudy costume of the
ring. They were really skillful. While we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
watching with interest the acrobatic performance,
a squadron of the Confederate General Imboden's
Cavalry dashed past us. Sergeant Reed, who had
just made me an offer for my watch, sprang to
his feet, exclaiming: "I swear! there must be a
battle going on in front, for there goes Jimboden's
Cavalry to the rear! Sure sign! I'll be hanged
if we ain't gettin' licked again!" We had heard
the cannonading in the distance, but paid little
attention to it. The Richmond papers, announcing
that Fisher's Hill was impregnable to the
whole Yankee army, were said to have been received
about an hour before the heights were actually
carried by storm. Again Early's army was
not captured, but sent "whirling up the valley."</p>

<p>We prisoners thoroughly enjoyed the changed
aspect of affairs. At first they marched us directly
back a short distance up the slope towards the
advancing Yankees; but they seemed suddenly to
discover their mistake; they halted, faced about,
and marched down. Hilarious and saucy, our
boys struck up the song and three hundred voices
swelled the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rally round the flag, boys, rally once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Union forever! hurrah, boys, hurrah!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down with the traitor! up with the star! etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>till Captain Haslett of the provost guard came
riding into the midst with savage oaths shouting,
"<i>Silence!</i> <span class="smcapl">SILENCE!</span> SILENCE!"</p>

<p>Twenty-seven miles, first through stifling dust
and then through pelting rain, past Hawkinstown,
Woodstock, Edenburg, Mount Jackson, brought
us to New Market. On the march Colonel Brinton
of a Pennsylvania regiment, a new arrival, planned
with me an escape. He had campaigned through
the valley, was familiar with the lay of the land,
and said he had friends among the inhabitants.
Our plan was to run past the guards in the darkness.
As a preliminary step I cut off my shoulder-straps
which were very bright. Within half an
hour Sergeant Reed came up to me and asked,
"Colonel, where's your shoulder-straps?" I replied,
"I don't wear shoulder-straps now I'm a
prisoner." "But, Colonel," he answered, "I've
been lookin' at them shoulder-straps since we left
Tom's Brook. I wanted to buy 'em of you for a
present to one of my girls. I'll be hanged if I
don't believe you're goin' to try to escape, and so
you've cut off your bright shoulder-straps. But,
Colonel, it's impossible. I'll be hanged if I hadn't
rather lose any six of the others than to lose you."
The fellow stuck closer to me than a brother all the
rest of that night; so close that he lost sight of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Colonel Brinton, who actually escaped about midnight
at a place called Edenburg! Almost immediately
Sergeant Reed came to me and asked,
"Colonel, where's that other Colonel?" I answered:
"You ought to know; <i>I</i> don't!"&mdash;"I'll be hanged,"
said he, "if I haven't lost him, a-watchin' you!"</p>

<p>At New Market they put us into a dilapidated
church building. "The wicked flea, when no man
pursueth but the righteous, is bold as a lion," was
repeatedly misquoted from the <i>Book of Proverbs</i>,
and not without reason. We concluded if that
interpretation was correct, we had reason enough
for obeying the injunction in <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, "Be not
righteous overmuch"; for the little jumpers were
fearless and countless. They were reinforced by a
Confederate deacon, who recommended two things:
Confederate paper and "gospel piety"; the one
would carry us safely through this world; the other
through the next. He would be only too happy
to furnish us the currency in exchange for our
greenbacks. "Confederate treasury bills and true
religion" was the burden of his song, till one of
our literary officers, it was said, squelched him:
"Deacon, your recipe of happiness, rebel paper
and godliness&mdash;Confederate money and a Christian
spirit!&mdash;reminds me of what Byron says in
one of his wicked poems:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Beyond all doubt there's nought the spirit cheers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like rum and true religion!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">He subsided.</p>

<p>We left New Market at noon, Saturday, September
24th, and marched all the afternoon and all
night, past Harrisonburg, Mount Crawford, Mount
Sidney, and Willow Springs, reaching Staunton, Va.,
about nine in the morning. On the march, forty-three
miles in twenty-one hours, we were hungry;
for the morning ration at New Market was scanty,
and they gave us nothing more, except a small
loaf of wheat bread. Some of the guard were kind
to us. One of them, private John Crew, Co. E,
11th Alabama Regiment, unsolicited by us, and,
so far as I am aware, without hope of any reward,
would endeavor to bring us apples or other food,
whenever we halted. I was careful to write his
name in my diary.</p>

<p>As we trudged along, a lively discussion of
slavery ensued. Lieutenant Howard of the provost
guard was a learned champion of the "peculiar
institution," and I was a pronounced abolitionist.
He was an ardent "fire-eater," to use the term
then in vogue, and I, who had lost my position
as principal of the Worcester High School by
my defense of John Brown, was equally intense.
Both were pretty well "posted" on the subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
He seemed to be familiar with the Bible and the
proslavery arguments, including drunken Noah's
"Cursed Canaan!" Moses Stuart's <i>Conscience and
the Constitution</i>, Nehemiah Adams's <i>Southside View
of Slavery</i>, and Rev. Dr. &mdash;&mdash; (the name is gone from
me) of Baltimore's Sermons. I was fresh from
reading the arguments of George B. Cheever,
Horace Bushnell, Henry Ward Beecher, Garrison,
Phillips, and the rest. He proved that slavery
among the Hebrews was a divine institution. I
answered they were commanded to "undo the
heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, and break
every yoke." He said Paul sent back the fugitive
slave Onesimus to his master Philemon; I rejoined,
"Paul said, 'I send him back, not as a
servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved;
receive him as myself.'" He quoted the Constitution
of the United States, the article commanding
that fugitive slaves should be delivered back to
their masters; in reply I quoted from Deuteronomy
the "Higher Law," "Thou shalt <i>not</i> deliver unto
his master the servant which is escaped from
his master unto thee." He quoted from the
great speech of the magnificent Webster in the
Senate, March 7, 1850, in which he urged all
good citizens to obey the Fugitive Slave Law "with
alacrity." Waxing hot, I quoted from Beecher:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As to those provisions which concern aid to fugitive
slaves, may God do so to us, yea and more also, if we
do not spurn them as we would any other mandate of
Satan! If in God's providence fugitives ask bread
or shelter, raiment or conveyance at my hands, my
own children shall lack bread ere they; my own flesh
shall sting with cold ere they shall lack raiment. And
whatsoever defense I would put forth for mine own
children, that shall these poor, despised, persecuted
creatures have at my hands and on the road. The
man that would do otherwise, that would obey this
law to the peril of his soul and the loss of his manhood,
were he brother, son, or father, shall never
pollute my hand with grasp of hideous friendship,
nor cast his swarthy shadow athwart my threshold!</p></div>

<p>The lieutenant finally cited the examples of
"those glorious southern patriots who led the rebellion
against England during the first American
Confederacy," Washington, Patrick Henry, Madison,
Jefferson, "every one a slaveholder," he
proudly exclaimed. I happened to be cognizant of
their views, and responded with some vehemence:
"But Washington's hands were tied so that he
could not free slaves till his death. He said
it was among his first wishes to see some plan
adopted for putting an end to slavery. Patrick
Henry declared, 'I will not, I cannot justify it.'
Madison expressed strongly his unwillingness to
admit in the national Constitution 'the idea that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
can hold property in man.'" In a rather loud
voice I quoted Jefferson, who, in view of our
inconsistency in violating the "self-evident truth"
that "all men are created equal," solemnly affirmed,
"<i>I tremble for my country, when I remember
that God is just, and that his justice cannot sleep
forever</i>!" I had some reputation as an elocutionist
in those days, and Sergeant Reed, who was listening
with open mouth, broke in with, "I'll be
hanged, Colonel, if you warn't cut out for a preacher!
By&mdash; I should like to hear you preach."
The best reply I could make was: "You'll undoubtedly
be hanged sometime; and if I were a
minister, nothing would give me more satisfaction
than to be present at your execution and
preach your funeral sermon." He replied: "Now,
Colonel, you don't mean that. You don't think
I'll ever be hanged!"&mdash;"Indeed I do, if you don't
stop your profanity and general cussedness."&mdash;"I'll
be hanged, if I will," was his last word to me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>At Staunton&mdash;Thence to Waynesboro, Meacham's, and
Richmond.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Staunton we got a little more light on the
value of Confederate paper. A chivalrous surgeon
who accompanied the provost guard (Fontleroy,
I think, was his name<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>) politely invited Captain
Dickerman of the 26th Massachusetts and myself
to take breakfast with him in a restaurant. We
needed no urging. The Provost Marshal gave
consent. The saloon was kept by a negro named
Jackson. His entire stock of provisions consisted
of nine eggs, the toughest kind of neck beef, bread
and salt, coffee very weak, butter very strong. As
we sat waiting, the doctor remarked with a lordly
air that under ordinary circumstances he would not
deign to eat with Yankees. I answered good-naturedly:
"I'm as much ashamed as you can be;
and if <i>you'll</i> never tell of it, <i>I</i> won't!" The food,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
notwithstanding its toughness, rapidly disappeared.
Near the last mouthful the doctor said: "You two
will have to pay for this breakfast, for I've no
money." I had fifteen Confederate dollars remaining
of twenty which I had received for a five-dollar
greenback at Tom's Brook, and I answered:
"Give yourself no anxiety; I'll foot the bill."&mdash;"Well,
Jackson," said I to the sable proprietor,
"what's the damage?" He replied, "I shan't
charge you-ones full price. Let's see! Beef, seven;
eggs, two&mdash;nine; coffee, three&mdash;twelve; bread and
butter, three&mdash;fifteen; three of you&mdash;forty-five.
I'll call it only thirty-six dollars!" I paid my
fifteen; Captain Dickerman pleaded poverty; and
the dignified doctor, who had so cordially invited
us to partake of his hospitality, promised the
disappointed Jackson that he would pay the balance
at some future day ("the futurest kind of a
day," was added in an undertone).</p>

<p>Rejoining the three or four hundred prisoners,
we found, besides the Confederate guards, a great
crowd of spectators swarming around us. One
of them, a fine-looking young man, wearing the
blue uniform of a United States captain, made
his way through the group, and handed me a
twenty-dollar Confederate bill! The following
dialogue ensued:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, Colonel, take that."</p>

<p>"I thank you much. Who are you, so kind to a
stranger and an enemy?"</p>

<p>"I'm one whom you Yanks would hang, if you
could catch me."</p>

<p>"Why so? Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm one of Morgan's guerrillas; wouldn't you
hang me?"</p>

<p>"I think I should, if you had much of this stuff
about you" (holding up the twenty-dollar bill);
"I've just paid fifteen Confederate dollars for an
imaginary breakfast."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Colonel. Here, take another
twenty. Now you've forty. That'll pay for an
imaginary dinner. Good-bye, Colonel! I have
an engagement&mdash;to meet some of your cavalry.
Remember, Morgan's guerrillas are not rascals,
but gentlemen. Good-bye!" He vanished.</p>

<p>About noon those of us who appeared unable to
march farther were put on top of freight cars, and
carried about a dozen miles east to Waynesboro.
Here the railway crosses a stream, which encircles
a little island just north of the bridge. The
majority had to walk. At dusk that Sunday
evening all had come. They put us on the island
carefully guarded on all sides. Never was I more
thankful. I had had something good to eat at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Staunton; had got rested riding on the roof of the
car; and I had my overcoat. Davy Crockett
preferred a heap of chestnut burs for a pillow;
but I followed the patriarch's example and chose a
flat stone. People never allowed me to sing; but
I dropped asleep repeating the stanza in Mrs.
Adams's exquisite hymn.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though, like the wanderer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sun gone down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkness be over me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My rest a stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in my dreams I'd be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer, my God, to thee!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">Towards midnight the cold became so keen that I
rose and went to the side of a flickering fire. Here
excessive misery was for a moment hardening the
hearts it should have softened. Several prisoners
were quarreling for a position nearest the embers,
each angrily claiming that he had brought the
fagots that were burning! Two or three hours
later several of us attempted to slip past the
sentries in the darkness, but were stopped before
we reached the water.</p>

<p>At earliest streak of dawn we were marched
away. About two miles brought us to the Blue
Ridge where the railroad tunnel pierces its foundations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
We toiled up and on in time to see the sun
rise. An ocean of fog lay around us. Never shall
we forget how royally the King of Day scaled the
great wall that seemed to hem in on every side the
wide valley, and how the sea of mist and cloud visibly
fled before the inrolling flood of light, unveiling
green and yellow fields, flocks and herds, dark woodlands,
dwellings yet asleep in peace and plenty,
here and there the silver thread of a winding
stream with lakes that mirrored the sky, and
yonder the long stretches of those titanic fortifications
encompassing all. We were reminded
of Shakespeare's sunrise:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At that instant a train of cars from Charlottesville
came sliding along, and shot</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Into the tunnel, like a lightning wedge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By great Thor hammers driven through the rock!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">The scene startled us by its sublimity, and for a
few minutes the hungry forgot their craving,
the footsore their pain, the hopeless their despair.</p>

<p>That day's march, though not so long was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
severe as any; we were exhausted. Private Dolan,
Co. K, 159th N. Y., was barefoot. His feet were
blistered and bleeding. I begged the commander of
the provost guard, Captain Haslett, to allow him
to get into an ambulance. My request was not
granted. But we soon afterwards passed a large
mansion in front of which were several girls and
women apparently making fun of the unwashed
"Yank" and evidently enjoying the spectacle.
We were halted just as Dolan came limping along
supported on one side by a stronger comrade.
They saw his miserable plight, his distress, his
swollen feet, and they heard of the stern command
to shoot any prisoner who fell out or lagged
behind. Their faces changed. With tears one
or two implored the Captain to let him ride in
the ambulance. He yielded to their entreaties.
Southern ladies almost always seemed handsome to
us, but these in my memory have the fairest faces.
I thought of Lady Clare in <i>Marmion</i>, and the
words still recur:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Woman! in our hours of ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And variable as the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the light quivering aspen made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When pain and anguish wring the brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ministering angel thou!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Two miles before we reached our temporary
destination, Meacham's Station, my own strength
utterly failed. I had borne up so long, partly
to set an example of cheerful endurance, and
partly from something like Mark Tapley's pride
at coming out strong and jolly under the most
depressing circumstances. I lay beside the road,
remarking to Captain Haslett, who immediately
came riding to the spot, "Captain, here's a fine
chance to try your marksmanship; I can't march
any further; shan't try to."&mdash;"Colonel," he
replied with something of pity in his tone and
manner, "I'm sorry to see you so used up. I'm
sorry to be obliged to march you prisoners so hard.
I have to keep out of the way of your damned
cavalry. You may get into the ambulance."
So into the ambulance I climbed with some difficulty,
and immediately commenced my freemasonry
on the driver. He responded to the signs.
He proved to be an acquaintance of the Redwoods,
a family in Mobile, one of whom had been a classmate
of mine at Yale. He gave me some nice
milk and some fine wheat bread. "As a Mason,"
said he, "I'll feed you; share the last crumb with
you; but as a Confederate soldier I'll fight you till
the last drop of blood and the last ditch."&mdash;"I
hardly know which to admire most, your spunk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
or your milk," I replied. Thereupon he gave me
another drink, and insisted on my imbibing a little
of what he called "apple-jack." I was a "teetotaler";
but thinking the occasion warranted,
I "smiled" upon it, "strictly as a medicine!"
"Apple-jack" seemed to me the same thing as
"Jersey lightning." He became quite friendly,
but was horribly profane. "Look here," said he,
"you seem to be a sort of Christian; cuss me if you
don't! What in h&mdash;l are you Yanks all comin'
down here for?"&mdash;"You have a gift at swearing,"
I said; "did you, among your other oaths, ever
swear to support the Constitution of the United
States?"&mdash;"Well, yes."&mdash;"That's what's the
matter with us," I said, "we're keeping our oaths
and you are breaking yours."&mdash;"To h&mdash;l with the
Constitution of the United States! Our first duty
is to our own State. We've a right to be an
independent nation, and we will. I'm a guerrilla.
If our armies are defeated, I'll fight you on my own
hook. I'll fire on you from behind every tree
and every rock. I'll assassinate every invader. I
want you to remember that I'm a guerrilla."&mdash;"I
like your <i>spirits</i>," I said. "They are worthy of a
better cause."&mdash;"Take another swallow of 'em,"
he replied, handing me the canteen. I toasted
him: "Here's hoping you gorillas will outlive the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Southern Confederacy!"&mdash;"A d&mdash;d equivocal
sentiment," observed my fire-eating, fire-drinking
Masonic brother; "but here we are at Meacham's
Station. Good-bye, Yank!"</p>

<p>After our nineteen miles' march it was a most
welcome relief to be placed on platform cars,
though packed so closely that we could hardly stir.
We objected that the cars had no tops. "All
the better opportunity to study astronomy,"
they replied.&mdash;"The cars have no sides to keep
off the wind."&mdash;"The scenery is magnificent," they
rejoined, "and they'll answer for 'observation
cars'; you have an unobstructed view."&mdash;"But
the nights are growing cold."&mdash;"You'll keep warm
by contact with each other." Mad at this
mockery, hungry, half-frozen, squeezed like fish
in a basket, we took little note of scenery or stars;
but it was a comfort to believe that our discomfort
was caused by the rapid advance of Sheridan's
cavalry.</p>

<p>More dead than alive, though hardly dead
enough to bury, having been jolted along all the
afternoon and all night, we reached Richmond
about sunrise, Tuesday, September 27th. Numbering
now nearly four hundred we were escorted
through the streets to the notorious Libby prison
and halted in front. The Union officers inside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
thronged the windows to see us come. On every
face was a sad, despondent, pitying look, the most
discouraging sight I ever saw. No smiles there
nor among us. Conspicuous among them was the
sorrowful countenance of Lieut.-Col. Charles H.
Hooper of the 24th Massachusetts Infantry, with
his long handsome auburn beard. Some one inside
whispered loud enough for several of our "Four
Hundred" to hear, "Hide your greenbacks!" We
passed the word down the column, "Hide your
greenbacks!"</p>

<p>A few minutes revealed its significance. We
were taken in a body in upon the lower floor.
There Major Nat. Turner, prison inspector,
cousin of the celebrated Dick Turner of unlovely
reputation, made us a speech.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">You will empty your pockets of all valuables. Such
as are not contraband of war, you will be allowed to
retain. You will deliver up all your Federal money.
An equivalent amount in Confederate money will be
given you in instalments from time to time, or the
whole will be returned to you when you are exchanged.
You will turn pockets inside out. If you attempt
to conceal anything, it will be confiscated.</p></div>

<p>We were made to step forward singly, and were
searched. Our coats and vests were taken off,
also our boots and shoes; and a Confederate officer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
felt very carefully of all our clothing to make sure
that nothing was hidden. I "remembered to forget"
that I had two ten-dollar greenbacks compressed
into a little wad in one corner of my watch
fob; and that corner escaped inspection. Dick
Turpin never was the richer for that money.
They examined suspiciously a pocket edition of
the New Testament in the original Greek; but I
assured them it was not some diabolical Yankee
cipher, and they allowed me to keep it. I made
the most of my freemasonry, and they permitted
me to retain my overcoat. One of our prisoners,
it was whispered, had secretly stuffed $1300 in
greenbacks into his canteen, but all canteens were
taken from us as contraband of war, and nobody
but "Uncle Sam" profited by the concealment.</p>

<p>Having "gone through" us, they incarcerated
the officers in one room, the enlisted men in
another.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>At Libby&mdash;Thence to Clover, Danville, Greensboro, and Salisbury&mdash;Effort
to Pledge us not to Attempt Escape.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two rooms at Libby adjoined each other
on the second floor, but a solid brick wall was
between them. When we entered, about a hundred
and fifty officers were already there. The
first thing that attracted my attention was an
officer putting a loaf of bread through a small
hole in the partition where one or two bricks
were removable. He was feeding a hungry
prisoner. A cap or hat nicely concealed the
perforation.</p>

<p>Libby has a hard name, but it was the most
comfortable of the six Confederate prisons of
which I saw the interior. With all his alleged
brutal severity, of which I saw no manifestation,
and his ravenous appetite for greenbacks, for
which we could not blame him, Dick Turner
seemed an excellent disciplinarian. Everything
went like clockwork. We knew what to expect
or rather what not to expect, and <i>when</i>! My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
diary for Wednesday, September 28, 1864, the
day after our arrival, reads as follows:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The issue to us daily is<br /></span>
<span class="i4">One gill of boiled beans,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">One quarter gill of bean broth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">One half loaf of soft bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">(Four ounces meat) and<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A little salt.<br /></span></div></div>

<p>There was one inestimable boon, a copious
supply of pure water.</p>

<p>There were at this time no panes of glass, in
fact no sashes, in the windows, and the wind swept
freely through. The nights were becoming cold.
Confederate sentries were on the lower floor and
outside. They kept up a custom rather unusual,
I think, during the war, of calling out in sing-song
tones every hour the number of the post and the
time, with occasional variations; <i>e. g.</i>: "Post
number fourteen, two o'clock, and all's well."
Then the next sentinel would sing out, "Post number
fifteen, two o'clock, and all's well." Then the
melodious voice of the next, farther away and
sadly unorthodox, "Post number sixteen, two
o'clock, and cold as h&mdash;l!"</p>

<p>Except one or two rickety tables and two or
three old chairs, there was no furniture in the
prison. Some of the officers had contrived to save<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a little money when searched, and with money it
was possible to procure small articles slyly smuggled
in contrary to orders; but most of us were disposed
to sing with old Isaac Watts,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear Lord, and shall we ever live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this poor dying rate?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the rear windows we were occasionally
entertained with the sight of exploding shells,
which the indefatigable Grant was daily projecting
towards Richmond. Particularly was this the
case on the thirtieth of the month, when the boys
in blue captured Fort Harrison, and the next day
when the Confederates made several gallant but
unsuccessful attempts to retake it. At such times
we could see some of the steeples or high roofs in
Richmond thronged with non-combatants gazing
anxiously towards Petersburg. The belief that
our prison was undermined, a vast quantity of
gunpowder stored in the cellar, and that Dick
Turner had threatened and was desperate enough
to blow us all into eternity in case of a sudden dash
of our cavalry into Richmond, somewhat marred
the satisfaction with which we contemplated the
evident progress of the siege. We could sympathize
with the Philadelphia Friend, who said
to his wife on the introduction of gun-cotton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"What comfort can thee take, even when sitting
in thy easy chair, when thee knows not but the
very cushion underneath thee is an enormous
bomb-shell, ready upon the slightest concussion
to blow thee to everlasting glory?"</p>

<p>At three o'clock, Sunday morning, October 2d,
we were roused by the entry of armed men with
lanterns. They furnished each of us with a dirty
haversack containing what they called two days'
rations of corn bread and meat. Then they moved
us single-file down stairs. As we passed, they
took from each his blanket, even those the officers
had just bought and paid for. If we expostulated,
we were told we were going to a place where we
should not need blankets! For my freemasonry
or some other unexpressed reason, they allowed
me to pass, wearing my overcoat. Then they took
us by bridge across the James River, packed us in
box-cars on the railway, forty to sixty in each car,
and started the train southwest towards Danville.</p>

<p>The road-bed was bad and the fences on either
side were gone. We made but four or five miles
an hour. One of our officers declared that they
kept a boy running ahead of the engine with hammer
and nails to repair the track! also that they
put the cow-catcher on behind the last car to prevent
cattle from running over the train! At nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
o'clock in the evening we reached a place called
Clover. We passed the night in Clover! on the
bank beside the railroad, where we studied
astronomy! and meditated!</p>

<p>Next morning they repacked us, and we were
transported seventy miles farther to Danville.
My memorandum book mentions a conversation I
had on the way with a very young and handsome
rebel, one of the guard. He was evidently ingenuous
and sincere, pious and lovable. After a
few pleasant remarks he suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"What are you Northerners fighting for?"</p>

<p>"In defense of the Constitution and the Union.
What are <i>you</i> fighting for?"</p>

<p>"Every right that is sacred and dear to man."</p>

<p>"What right that is sacred and dear to man had
the United States ever violated before you fired
on Fort Sumter?"</p>

<p>Of course he fell back on the Declaration of
American Independence, that "Governments derive
their just powers from the consent of the
governed"; also on the doctrine so emphatically
expressed by Abraham Lincoln in his speech in
Congress in 1846; viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">Any people anywhere, being inclined and having
the power, have the right to raise up and shake off
the existing government, and form a new one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most
sacred right, a right which we hope and believe is to
liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases
in which the whole people of an existing government
may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people,
that can, may revolutionize and make their own of as
much territory as they inhabit.</p></div>

<p>We arrived at Danville at noon. A heavy rain
began to fall. Having been two days without
opportunity to wash, we were drenched for an hour
or two by the sweet shower that seemed to pour
from the open windows of heaven. When our
thoughtful guards concluded that we were sufficiently
cleansed and bleached, they sheltered us
by putting us into coal cars, where the black dust
was an inch deep. That dust was fine! but the
thought seemed to strike them that our nicely
laundered garments might get soiled. So in half
an hour they took us out and placed us in corn
cars. It rather went against the grain, but finally
I sat down with the other kernels on the floor.
The weather being inclement, they felt it their
duty to keep us in doors, lest we should catch
cold!</p>

<p>In these elegant and commodious vehicles we
were transported next day till we reached Greensboro,
North Carolina, about fifty miles southwest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from Danville. Disgorged like poor old Jonah after
three days' living burial, we were placed in the
beautiful open square, and never before did air,
earth, trees, and skies seem lovelier. Here they
gave each of us three horny crackers, "rebel hardtack,"
out of which some of us carved finger rings
that might have passed for bone.</p>

<p>In those days I was too much addicted to making
public speeches, a habit which I had contracted
in Yale College. On the edge of the public green,
backed by a hundred prisoners, I was haranguing
a crowd of curious spectators, telling them how
abominably we were treated, exhibiting to them
our single ration of flinty biscuit, and consigning
them all to everlasting perdition, when a well-dressed
young man elbowed his way to me at the
fence. He had a large black shiny haversack
swung under his left arm. Patting it with his
right hand, he asked:</p>

<p>"Will you have a snack?"</p>

<p>"A what?" I answered.</p>

<p>"A snack, a snack," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't know what a 'snack' is, unless it's a
<i>snake</i>. Yes, I think I could eat a copperhead&mdash;<i>cooked</i>.
Snake for one, if you please; well done."</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into his haversack; took out
and gave me the most delicious sandwich I ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
tasted. Seeing how I enjoyed it, he emptied
the satchel, giving all his food to my hungry fellow
prisoners. He told me he was just starting on a
long journey, and had laid in a good stock of
provisions. I took pains to write in my journal
his name and residence&mdash;"George W. Swepson,
Alamance, North Carolina. Lives near the Court
House." To which I added "<i>Vir et Amicus</i>."&mdash;"The
blessing of him that was ready to perish"
was upon George W. Swepson.</p>

<p>That night we slept again on the ground and
without covering under the open sky; and again
several prisoners, Captain Howe and myself among
them, attempted in vain to slip past the sentinels.</p>

<p>Next morning we re&euml;ntered the freight cars.
A twelve hours' ride brought us at nine o'clock,
Wednesday evening, October 5th, to our destination,
Salisbury, North Carolina. As the "Four
Hundred" passed into the dark enclosure, we were
greeted with the cry, "Fresh fish! Fresh fish!"
which in those days announced the arrival of a
new lot of prisoners. We field officers were
quartered that night in a brick building near the
entrance, where we passed an hour of horrors.
We were attacked by what appeared to be an
organized gang of desperadoes, made up of thieves,
robbers, Yankee deserters, rebel deserters, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
villains generally, maddened by hunger, or bent on
plunder, who rejoiced in the euphonious appellation
of <i>Muggers</i>! We had been warned against
them by kindly disposed guards, and were not
wholly unprepared. They attacked us with clubs,
fists, and knives, but were repeatedly driven off,
pitched headlong downstairs. "<i>Muggers!</i>"</p>

<p>Salisbury prison, then commonly called "Salisbury
penitentiary," was in the general form of a
right-angled triangle with base of thirty or forty
rods, perpendicular eighty or ninety. In a row
parallel to the base and four or five rods from it
were four empty log houses with a space of about
four rods between each two. These, a story and
a half high, had formerly been negro quarters.
On each side of the great triangle was a stout
tight board fence twelve or fifteen feet high.
Some two or three feet from the top of this, but
out of our sight because on the other side, there
was evidently a board walk, on which sentinels,
four or five rods apart, perpetually paced their
beats, each being able to see the whole inside of
the enclosure. At each angle of the base was a
shotted field-piece pointing through the narrow
opening. We could see that behind each cannon
there was a number of muskets stacked and vigilant
soldiers watching every movement inside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Close to the fence outside there were three camps
of Confederates, variously estimated to contain
from seven hundred to two thousand in all.</p>

<p>The number of Union officers in prison after our
arrival was about three hundred and twenty; the
number of non-commissioned officers and privates
was suddenly increased from about two
thousand to some eight thousand. Among these
were non-combatants, refugees, lighthouse keepers,
and other government employees. Albert D.
Richardson, then well-known as a correspondent
of the New York <i>Tribune</i>, whose romantic marriage
to Abby Sage by Henry Ward Beecher and
whose tragic death created a sensation in the
newspaper world, had been held as a prisoner
there for several months. He told us he had
found Salisbury a comfortable place. It immediately
ceased to be such.</p>

<p>There stood the empty log houses. We besought
the rebel commandant, Major Gee, to allow
us officers to occupy those buildings. He said he
would permit it on condition that we should sign
a stringent parole, binding us on our honor not
to attempt to escape! We objected to it as a
preposterous requirement that, remaining under
strict guard and wholly cut off from communication
with the outside world, we should sign such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a pledge as the only condition on which we could
receive decent shelter. I asked Major Gee if the
rigor of our confinement would be in any way
relaxed. He answered bluntly, "No."&mdash;"Well,
where's the reciprocity?" I demanded; "what
are you giving up?"&mdash;"Well," he replied, "if
you don't choose to sign the parole, you can't
have the buildings. Other Federal officers have
not objected to signing it." He showed us the
signature of Gen. Michael Corcoran, who had
been colonel of the 69th New York, was captured
at the first battle of Bull Run, was
promoted to be brigadier, and who raised the
so-called "Corcoran Legion." Our senior officer,
Brig.-Gen. Joseph Hayes of the Fifth Corps,
now called a meeting of the field officers, and
submitted the question, "Shall we sign the parole,
and so obtain shelter? Or shall we hold ourselves
free to escape if we can, and so share the privations
of our enlisted men, who have no bed but the
ground and no covering but the sky?" I spoke
strongly against making any promise. We voted
almost unanimously against it.</p>

<p>General Hayes and others then urged upon the
commandant the absurdity and meanness of
requiring it. It was clear to us and must have
been so to him that it was for his interest to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
separate the three or four hundred officers from
the thousands of prisoners accustomed to obey
our orders. He finally consented that we should
occupy the houses without imposing any conditions.</p>

<p>Parallel to the front of these buildings, about
five rods from them and extending across the
enclosure, was a so-called "dead line," on which
nine sentinels paced their beats. Another "dead
line" about four rods from the high fence paralleled
the whole length of each side of the prison.
It was death to come near these.</p>

<p>About eighty officers were assigned to each of the
four houses. In each an officer was elected to serve
as house-commissary. His duty was to receive the
rations from Lieutenant-Colonel Hooper, already
mentioned, acting as commissary-general, to whom
the Confederate authorities delivered them in
bulk. The house-commissary distributed the food
and acted as agent representing the house in all
communications with Confederate headquarters.
Col. Gilbert G. Prey of the 104th N. Y. Vols.
was elected commissary of house number one;
Capt. D. Tarbell, of Groton, N. Y., commissary
of house number two; Lieutenant Reilly of
Philadelphia, of house number three; and I of
house four.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Each house contained but two rooms, a lower
and an upper, both empty, for the most part without
glass windows or even sashes; the spaces
between the crooked logs not stopped up; a single
fireplace in each house, but not half enough wood
to keep a blaze; without tables, benches, or chairs;
without cooking utensils; without table, knife, fork,
spoon, or plate; often without cup or dish; without
blankets, or any clothing but the scantiest summer
outfit; without books or papers; without
water sufficient for washing, or soap, if we could
possibly get water; we were in a sorry plight as
the nights grew colder. And if the prospect was
bad for us, how much worse for our soldiers across
the "dead line," who had no shelter, hardly a
scrap of blanket! Every rain made their beds
a pool or mass of mire. It is not pleasant, but it
is a duty to record some of the shadows of our
prison life, "lest we forget."</p>

<p>On the open ground outside of what was called
the "hospital," October 8th, a sergeant-major
was found dead; October 9th, two private soldiers;
October 13th, five; October 14th, two;
October 16th, eleven; October 17th, seven; October
18th, nine. We could tell how severe the weather
had been at night by the number found dead in
the morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the prison enclosure was an
abundance of growing timber. More than once
I besought Major Gee to allow our men to go,
under guard on parole, to get wood for fires and
for barracks. He refused. He said he was
intending to build barracks for the prisoners as
soon as he could procure lumber. I presume that
he was sincere in this. I asked in vain for blankets
for the men; for tents, but none came till December,
and then but one "Sibley" tent and one
"A" tent per hundred prisoners, not enough for
one-third of them.</p>

<p>We procured water from a deep well on the
grounds. The supply was so scanty for the
thousands of prisoners that it was always exhausted
before sunrise. Soon after we came the Confederates
commenced digging two new wells. At their
rate of progress we reckoned it would take several
months to finish either.</p>

<p>My memorandum book shows that the issue
of food daily at Salisbury, though sometimes
partly withheld, was for each prisoner "one half
loaf of soft bread; two, three, four, or five ounces
of meat; a gill of boiled rice, and a little salt." I
have no doubt that Major Gee meant to deal
fairly with us; but he was unprepared for the avalanche
that had descended upon him. We are too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
much in the habit of blaming individual combatants
for severities and cruelties that are inherent
in the whole business of war, either civil or
international, and inseparable from it. Said our
Lieut.-Gen. S. M. B. Young at a banquet in
Philadelphia, "War is necessarily cruel; it is
kill and burn, and burn and kill, and again
kill and burn." The truth was more bluntly
expressed by the British Rear-Admiral Lord
Fisher, now the first sea lord of the British
Admiralty:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">Humanizing war? [said he]; you might as well talk
of humanizing hell! When a silly ass got up at the
first Hague Peace Conference in 1899, and talked
about the "amenities of warfare" and putting your
prisoners' feet in warm water and giving them gruel,
my reply, I regret to say, was considered brutally
unfit for publication. As if war could be "civilized"!
If I am in command when war breaks out, I shall
issue as my orders, "The essence of war is violence.
Moderation is imbecility. <i>Hit first, hit hard, hit
everywhere.</i>"</p></div>

<p>In this light we may view more charitably the
slaying, on the 16th of October at Salisbury, of
Second Lieutenant John Davis of the 155th N. Y.
It was a Sunday morning about half-past ten
o'clock. One of our fellow prisoners, Rev. Mr.
Emerson, chaplain of a Vermont regiment, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
circulated notice that he would conduct religious
services in the open air between houses number
three and four. The officers were beginning to assemble
when the sharp report of a musket near by
was heard. Rushing to the spot, we found the lieutenant
lying on his back dying at the "dead line."
The sentinel on the fence, a mere boy, had fired
upon him, and was now reloading. One of our
number, Captain William Cook, unable to restrain
his anger, hurled a large stone at him. But the
hundreds of Confederates in the camps just beyond
the fence had sprung to arms at the sound of the
firing; the top of the fence was being lined with
soldiers; and the vigilant cannoneers at the angles
were training their artillery upon our dense mass
of officers. We prisoners regarded the shooting
as a brutal murder. The religious exercises were
turned into a funeral service. Chaplain Emerson
prayed, "O God! our only refuge in this dark hour,
avenge the atrocious murder of our beloved comrade;
protect that widow so cruelly robbed of one
dearer to her than life; and especially grant that
this accursed Confederacy may speedily sink into
its native hell!" His text was from <i>Isaiah</i> viii, 12:
"Say ye not a Confederacy!" Next day I asked
the officer of the guard if any punishment was
to be inflicted upon the sentinel. He answered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
"No; we don't punish men for doing their
duty."</p>

<p>So vitally important is the point of view in
deciding upon the right or wrong of an act.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>At Salisbury&mdash;Great Plot to Escape&mdash;How Frustrated.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we arrived at Salisbury early in October,
we found there a brave and sagacious officer,
Lieut. Wm. C. Manning of the 2d Massachusetts
Cavalry. He told us he had been held as a
hostage in solitary confinement, and would have
starved but for the rats he caught and ate. He
had been notified that his own life depended upon
the fate of a person held in federal hands as a spy.
He determined to attempt an escape. He was
assigned to my house. Taking up a part of the
floor, he commenced digging a tunnel. He wrote
a solemn pledge which all the officers in the house
signed, binding them not to divulge the scheme.
The tunnel would have had to be about eight rods
long, and its outlet would necessarily have been
near a group of rebel tents. Of course it would
have been discovered on the morning after its
completion, and not all could hope to find egress
that way. But he believed that his life was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in special danger, and he at once began excavating.
The house had no cellar, but there was plenty
of room under it for stowing away the loose
earth. The ground was not hard, yet it was quite
firm, and on the whole favorable for such operations.
The work was progressing finely, till
the officers were suddenly removed from Salisbury
in consequence of the discovery of a great plot.</p>

<p>I had become a good deal interested in Manning
and his tunnel plan, and on the morning of Wednesday,
October 12th, I introduced him to General
Hayes, our senior officer. He told us he had for
several days been considering the possibility of
organizing the three or four hundred officers, and
the five to ten thousand soldiers. He believed
that by a simultaneous assault at many points we
could seize the artillery, break the fence, capture
the three rebel camps, then arm and ration this
extemporized army, and march away. He showed
us a good map of North Carolina. He invited all
of the field officers to meet that evening in the
garret of house number two. All of them accordingly,
about thirty in number, were present.
Posting sentinels to keep out intruders, and stopping
the open windows so that the faint light of
a tallow candle might not betray us or create suspicion,
we sat down in the gloom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The general had modestly absented himself, in
order that we might be uninfluenced by him in
reaching a decision; but our first step was to
send for him, and then insist on his taking the
chair&mdash;<i>the</i> chair, for we had but one! As he had
made a careful study of the subject, we pressed
him to give his views. He proceeded to state the
grounds of his belief that it was practicable to
strike an effective blow for our liberation. He told
us that he had communicated with a Union man
outside, and had learned the number and location
of the Confederate troops we should be likely to
encounter on our march to East Tennessee. He
explained at some length the details of his plan,
the obstacles we should encounter, and how to
overcome them. I shall never forget the conclusion
of his speech. These were almost exactly his
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">We must organize; organize victory. The sooner
we act the better, provided we have a well-arranged
plan. We can capture this town, ration our men,
provide them with shoes, clothing, and muskets, and
have a formidable army right here at once. It need
not take more than half a day. Certainly we can march
off within twenty-four hours after the first blow is
struck, if we begin right. The enemy have a few guns
on the hill, but they are not "in battery". We can
take these and take the artillery here right along with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
us. The principal obstacle is here; make the beginning
right; master these prisons and these camps, and we
are safe. Organize is the word; <i>organize</i>. If any one
shall betray us, or aid the rebels, or be guilty of robbery
or other outrage, I am in favor of a drumhead
court martial and a summary execution. Now, gentlemen,
I am ready to serve in any capacity, whether
to lead or to follow.</p></div>

<p>Colonel Ralston of the 24th N. Y. "dismounted
cavalry," as they were called, spoke next. He
was an energetic and dashing officer who fell near
me in an attempt to break out of Danville prison
on the tenth of the following December. He
entered into the particulars of a plan of action,
showing how easy it would be, with the probable
loss of but few lives, to capture the three camps
with the Salisbury arsenal and the artillery. As
his particular share in the work, he said he would
undertake with a small company to disarm the
twenty or thirty sentinels inside the enclosure,
and instantly thereupon to capture the headquarters
of Major Gee.</p>

<p>Other officers gave valuable suggestions. Being
called upon for my opinion, I spoke of the duty we
owed our enlisted men to extricate them from their
shocking condition, for they were beginning to die
every night on the bare ground, and would soon be
perishing by scores. I urged the effect the escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of some eight thousand prisoners would have upon
the nation, being equivalent to a great victory;
and, better than victory, it would add so many
thousands of trained soldiers at once to our armies
in the field. I insisted that this success would
be cheaply bought, even if it cost, as it probably
would, a hundred lives.</p>

<p>Of all our thirty field officers, only one opposed
the scheme (Lieut.-Col. G&mdash;&mdash;). He was acknowledged
to be brave,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but seemingly lacking in
enterprise. He said in substance, "I have carefully
examined the situation, and have come to the
conclusion that it is utterly useless to attempt to
escape by force. It can't be done at present. We
should be slaughtered by the hundred. If you all
vote to try it, I will join you; but in my opinion
it is perfect madness."</p>

<p>With but one dissenting voice it was resolved to
go ahead. A committee of five was immediately
appointed to prepare and present a plan of action.
This committee were Colonel Ralston; Col. W.
Ross Hartshorne, 190th Pa. (the famous "Bucktail
Regiment," whose first colonel, O'Neil, my Yale
classmate, was killed at Antietam); Col. James
Carle, 191st Pa.; Major John Byrne, 155th N. Y.;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and myself, Lieutenant-Colonel of the 13th Conn.
We were supposed to be fighting men, and had all
been wounded in battle.</p>

<p>A similar meeting of field officers was held the
following evening. For two days the committee was
almost continually in consultation with General
Hayes. Great pains was taken to have the plans
fully understood by all the officers and to secure
their hearty co&ouml;peration. By ingenious methods
frequent communication was had with the enlisted
men across the "dead line"; sometimes by hurling
written communications ballasted with stone;
several times by Lieutenant Manning and others
running swiftly past the sentinels in the dark; best
of all, because least liable to discovery, by the
use of the deaf-and-dumb alphabet. We were
suffering for want of water, and several officers got
permission to go outside the enclosure ostensibly
to procure it, but really to reconnoitre.</p>

<p>The committee reported the following plan,
which was unanimously adopted:</p>

<p>The first object in the movement being to get
into a hand-to-hand fight as soon as possible; seven
columns, each several hundred strong, were to
make simultaneous assaults upon six or seven
different points. The fence being the first impediment,
every man's haversack and pockets were to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
be filled with stones to keep down the sentinels
who would fire on us from the top. Some got
levers to wrench off boards, others logs to serve
as rude battering rams, others sharpened stakes
which Ralston called "Irish pikes," others clubs,
or any possible weapon. I had a rusty old
bayonet.</p>

<p>Major David Sadler, 2d Pennsylvania Heavy
Artillery, with his battalion was to rush and seize
the cannon and muskets at the angle on the right;
Major John Byrne and his column at the same
instant were to pounce upon the big gun and muskets
at the angle on our left; simultaneously Colonel
Ralston and his men are to dash upon the nine sentinels
on the "dead line" in front of the officers'
houses, in a moment disarming them and the nine of
the relief just arriving; then spring to the assistance
of Major August Haurand of the 4th N. Y. Cavalry
and his battalion who are capturing Major Gee's
headquarters and guards and camp on our right.
Col. James Carle, 191st Pa., with his hundreds is
breaking through the fence and capturing the rebel
camp in rear of the officers' quarters. Colonel, afterwards
General, W. Ross Hartshorne and his 330 men
of the 190th Pa. are to break the fence just above
the main rebel camp which is on our left. My own
column of about three hundred men of the Nineteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Corps are to break the fence just below the
rebel camp; then Hartshorne and I are to leap from
opposite sides upon this, the main camp. These
seven battalions were to some extent organized
with field, staff, and company officers. Every
officer and soldier was to be on the <i>qui vive</i> a
little before five o'clock in the morning, watching
intently for the signal. This was to be the waving
of a fire-brand by General Hayes in front of
house number two.</p>

<p>Quite a number of officers had no faith in the
plot, and they regarded it with indifference. A
few expressed hostility to it. One captain, who
had been a prisoner before and seemed glad
to have been captured again, a bloated, overgrown,
swaggering, filthy bully, of course a coward,
formerly a keeper of a low groggery and said
to have been commissioned for political reasons,
was repeatedly heard to say in sneering tones in
the hearing of rebel sentries, "<i>Some of our officers
have got escape on the brain</i>," with other words
to the like effect. Colonel Hartshorne finally
stopped such traitorous language by saying with
tremendous emphasis: "Captain D&mdash;&mdash;, I've heard
a good deal of your attempts to discourage officers
from escaping, and your loud talk about officers
having 'escape on the brain.' Now, sir, I give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
you notice that if you're again guilty of anything
of the sort, <span class="smcapl">I'LL&mdash;BREAK&mdash;YOUR&mdash;HEAD&mdash;WITH&mdash;A&mdash;CLUB</span>!"</p>

<p>The time agreed upon for the seven simultaneous
attacks was about an hour before sunrise the morning
of October 15th.</p>

<p>As we had feared, the rebel authorities, whether
through suspected treachery or otherwise, got
wind of our purpose. Towards evening of October
14th extraordinary vigilance on their part
became apparent. Troops were paraded, posts
strengthened, guards doubled, privileges restricted,
and word was passed around in our hearing that
a battalion of Confederates had just arrived.
Their watchfulness seemed unrelaxed through the
night. The shooting of Lieutenant Davis next
morning was doubtless in obedience to orders for a
more rigorous enforcement of rules.</p>

<p>Our outbreak was countermanded and postponed,
but preparations continued. The delay
enabled us to perfect our plans, and make our
organizations more complete. The early morning
of October 20th, the 19th being the anniversary
of my birth, was now fixed upon for the "insurrection."
We essayed to disarm suspicion by an
air of quiet acquiescence in the lazy routine of
prison life, or absorption in the simplest and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
innocent occupations whenever any Confederate
might be looking on.</p>

<p>We recognized united and instantaneous action
at the signal on the part of three hundred officers
and several thousand men as the most vitally
important element of success. It was necessary
that this should be thoroughly understood and
emphasized, so that every soldier should be in
perfect readiness at the critical moment.</p>

<p>Several of us had formed a class for oral instruction
in French. Our teacher was Captain Cook
of the 9th U. S. colored troops, a graduate of Yale.
About ten o'clock in the morning of October 18th,
as we were seated on the ground near house number
four, loudly imitating Professor Cook's <i>parlez-vous</i>,
Lieut. Wm. C. Gardner, adjutant of one
of those extemporized battalions of prisoners,
brought me a letter he was intending to throw
across the "dead line" to Sergt. Wallace W. Smith,
requesting him to notify all enlisted men of the
battalion when and where to assemble silently
next morning in the dark, how to arm themselves,
from whom to take orders, what signal to watch
for, and other important matters. I glanced
through it, and immediately said: "You'd better
not entrust the communication to so hazardous
a channel; wait an hour till I've done with my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
French lesson, and I'll cause it to be transmitted
by the deaf-and-dumb alphabet." If I recollect
rightly, either Lieutenant Tobey or Lieutenant
Morton, both of the 58th Massachusetts, was in
the class, and promised to convey the contents of
the letter safely across to the soldiers by adroit
finger manipulation. We were just finishing the
French exercise, when Adjutant Gardner came
greatly excited, and this conversation followed:</p>

<p class="pad1">"Good God, Colonel, the rebs have got that
letter! I tied it to a stone and flung it a long ways
over the 'dead line' to Wallace Smith. He appeared
afraid to pick it up. A reb sentinel stepped
away from his beat and got it."</p>

<p>"I requested you to wait till I'd done reciting
French, and I told you I'd then communicate it
by the deaf-and-dumb alphabet."</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel, I ought to have done so; but I
was anxious to have the work done promptly, and
I thought it was perfectly safe. I've tossed letters
over to Smith several times. I'm worried to death
about it. What's best to do?"</p>

<p>"Was your name signed to it?"</p>

<p>"No; but my name was on the envelope&mdash;an old
letter envelope that I had when we came here."</p>

<p>"Well, Gardner, this is a pretty piece of business!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
That letter of course will go very soon
to Major Gee's headquarters, and then&mdash;there'll
be the devil to pay!"</p>

<p>"The sentinel handed the letter to the officer
of the guard. What had I better say, if they
send for me?"</p>

<p>"Say you intended the letter to fall into their
hands; that you meant it as a practical joke,
wanted to get up another scare, and see the
Johnnies prick up their ears again."</p>

<p>"But, Colonel, like a fust-class fool I put a ten-dollar
Confederate bill in the envelope. I wanted
to give it to Sergeant Smith. That don't look as
if I meant it to fall into their hands&mdash;does it?"</p>

<p>"Gardner, this thing has an ugly look. You've
knocked our plans of escape in the head&mdash;at least
for the present. You've got yourself into a fix.
They'll haul you up to headquarters. They'll
prove by the letter that you've been deep in a
plot that would have cost a good many lives.
They're feeling ugly. They may hang or shoot
you before sundown, as a warning to the rest of
us to stop these plots to escape. They may send
for you at any minute."</p>

<p>"What had I better say or do?"</p>

<p>"You'd better make yourself scarce for a while,
till you've got a plausible story made up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Better disguise yourself and pass yourself off as
somebody else; so gain time."</p>

<p class="pad2">"I have it, Colonel; I'll pass myself off as
Estabrooks."</p>

<p>Estabrooks was an officer of the 26th Mass., who
had escaped at the crossing of the river Yadkin
two weeks previously when we came from Richmond.
Gardner was a handsome man and perhaps
the best-dressed officer in prison; but he now
disguised himself.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The transformation was complete.
In half an hour a man came to me wearing
a slouched hat and a very ragged suit of Confederate
gray. He had been a play-actor before the
war and knew how to conceal his identity. By
his voice I recognized him as Gardner! "Well,
Gardner," said I, "this surpasses His Satanic
Majesty; or, as you would say, beats the devil!"&mdash;"Colonel,"
he replied, "I'm not Gardner. Gardner
escaped; escaped at the crossing of the Yadkin
River. I'm Estabrooks, H. L. Estabrooks, 2d
Lieutenant, 26th Mass. Call me Estabrooks
if you please."&mdash;"All right, Estabrooks it is."</p>

<p>Hardly had we had time to whisper around this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
change of name, when the Confederate officer of
the guard made his appearance with two or three
soldiers, inquiring for the commissary of house
number four. I was pointed out to him. In substance
and almost in the exact words this dialogue
ensued:</p>

<p class="pad1">"Colonel Sprague, are you commissary of this
house?"</p>

<p>"I have that honor."</p>

<p>"I want to find Lieutenant Gardner."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Gardner."</p>

<p>"Who's Lieutenant Gardner?"</p>

<p>"I am told he's an officer in house number four;
and as you are commissary, you can probably tell
me where he is <i>at</i>."</p>

<p>"Where he's what?"</p>

<p class="pad2">"Where he's <i>at</i>."</p>

<p>This was the first time I had ever heard the word
<i>at</i> so used at the end of a sentence; but it expresses
the meaning with admirable precision. I had a
slight qualm at lying; but I remembered that even
George Washington could tell a lie if necessary in
war. Pacifying my conscience with the fact that
we were <i>outside</i> the house at the time, I said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p class="pad1">"There's no such officer in house four. But I
remember an officer of that name at Libby, handsomely
dressed, a perfect dandy. I heard that
he escaped at the crossing of the Yadkin River two
weeks ago. Has he been recaptured, and is he
going to be shot or hanged? Or have you a letter
for him? What's the good news about Gardner?"</p>

<p>"I only know," he replied, "that he's wanted
at Major Gee's office, and he's an officer in house
number four."</p>

<p>"Estabrooks," said I to the man at my side,
"do you know of a Lieutenant Gardner?"</p>

<p class="pad2">"I did know slightly such a man at Libby. You
have described him well; a fop, a beau, a dandy;
just about my size, but he didn't wear rags like I
do."</p>

<p>"Come with me," said I to the Confederate.
"We'll go into the house and inquire if any one
knows of a Lieutenant Gardner." We went in.
There were perhaps thirty or forty inside who had
got wind of what was going on. As we entered,
I asked in a loud voice, "Does any officer in this
house know anything of a Lieutenant Gardner?"
Several smiled and declared it a very singular
name. One wanted to know how it was spelled!
A number were speaking at once. One said he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
escaped at the Yadkin; he knew he got away, for
he "watched him till he got a long distance out
of sight." Another knew a Henry J. Gardner, "a
Know-Nothing" governor of Massachusetts, who
knew enough to keep out of the army. Another
affirmed that Gardner was dead; he had heard him
say "I'm a dead man," and he wouldn't tell a lie!
My memory is somewhat indistinct of all that
was said; but Gardner is alleged to have whispered
the officer thus: "I have been a gardener myself;
and if Major Gee will parole me and give me good
clothes and something to eat, I wouldn't mind
becoming again a gardener in his employ." I
recollect distinctly that the officer grew impatient
and he finally asked me, "Do you say on your
honor, Colonel, that you don't know a Lieut.
Wm. O. Gardner in this house?" I answered, "I
do"; but I left him to guess whether I meant "I
do <i>know</i>" or "I do <i>say</i>!" I quieted my conscientious
scruples by remembering that the lieutenant's
true name was not Wm. O. but Wm. C.!
The baffled officer left very angry, and "<i>Where's
Gardner at?</i>" passed into a conundrum.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, as I was engaged in the
delightful employment of washing my fall-and-winter
shirt, having for the first time since our
arrival in Salisbury obtained sufficient water for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that purpose, the order came for all officers to fall
in and take the cars for Danville, Va. The juxtaposition
of three or four hundred Yankee officers
with eight thousand of their enlisted comrades-in-arms
was getting dangerous.</p>

"Extract Sunshine from Cucumbers"&mdash;The Vermin&mdash;The
Prison Commandant a Yale Man&mdash;Proposed Theatricals&mdash;Rules

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> six o'clock, Wednesday evening, October
19, 1864, we officers, about 350 in number, were
packed in five freight cars, and the train was
started for Danville, Va. The tops of the cars
were covered with armed guards, two or three
being also stationed within at the side door of
each car. In the darkness about half-past nine
Lieut. Joseph B. Simpson of the 11th Indiana
slyly stole all the food from the haversacks of the
guards at the door of our car and passed it round
to us, while we loudly "cussed and discussed"
slavery and secession! About midnight Captain
Lockwood, Lieutenant Driscoll, and eight or ten
other officers leaped from the cars. The guards
opened fire upon them. Lockwood was shot dead.
Several were recaptured, and some probably
reached the Union lines in safety. We arrived
at Danville at noon October 20th.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The town at this time contained four, formerly
six, military prisons, each a tobacco house about
eighty to a hundred feet long by forty to fifty
wide, three stories high, built of brick, low between
joints. The officers were put into the building
known as prison number three. We were informed
by the guards that it had formerly contained
about two hundred negro prisoners; but that some
had died, others had been delivered to their
masters or set at work on fortifications, and the
number remaining just before our arrival was only
sixty-four. These were removed to make room
for us.</p>

<p>Except about twenty large stout wooden boxes
called spittoons, there was no furniture whatever
in prison number three. Conjecture was rife as
to the purpose of the Confederates in supplying us
with spittoons and nothing else. They were too
short for coffins, too large for wash bowls, too
shallow for bathing tubs, too deep for tureens!
To me much meditating on final causes, a vague
suspicion at length arose that there was some
mysterious relation between those twenty oblong
boxes and a score of hogsheads of plug tobacco,
said to be stored in the basement. A <i>tertium</i> <span class="smcapl">QUID</span>,
a solution of the tobacco, might afford a solution
of the spittoon mystery!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>A dozen water buckets were put into each of the
two upper rooms to which all the officers were
restricted; also a small cylinder coal stove; nothing
else until December, when another small stove
was placed there. Winter came early and unusually
cold. The river Dan froze thick. It was
some weeks before we prevailed upon the prison
commandant to replace with wood the broken-out
glass in the upper rooms. The first floor was
uninhabitable.</p>

<p>So with no bed nor blanket; no chairs, benches,
nor tables; no table-ware nor cooking utensils;
not even shovel, poker, or coal-scoop; most of us
were in a sorry plight. The little stoves, heated
white-hot, would have been entirely inadequate
to warm those rooms; but the coal was miserably
deficient in quality as well as quantity. The fire
often went out. To rekindle it, there was no
other way than to upset the whole, emptying ashes
and cinders on the floor. At best, the heat was
obstructed by a compact ring of shivering officers,
who had pre&euml;mpted positions nearest the stoves.
They had taken upon themselves to "run" the
thing; and they did it well. We called them "The
Stove Brigade." In spite of their efforts, they
like the rest suffered from cold.</p>

<p>Three or four of us, as a sanitary measure, made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
it a point to see, if possible, the funny, or at least
the bright side of everything, turn melancholy to
mirth, shadow to sunshine. When every officer
complained of cold, we claimed to anticipate the
philosophers, Tyndall, Huxley, and the other
physicists, in declaring that "heat is a mode of
<i>motion</i>," and brisk bodily exercise will infallibly
demonstrate the fact! When, as was usually the
case, all were hungry, we announced as a sure cure
for indigestion, "stop <i>eating</i>!" When our prisoner
chaplain Emerson on a Sunday afternoon prayed
for the dear ones we expected to see no more, and
even the roughest and most profane were in tears,
we said with old Homer, "<i>Agathoi aridakrues
andres</i>" ("Gallant men are easily moved to tears"),
or with Bayard Taylor, "The bravest are the
tenderest, the loving are the daring."</p>

<p>Most humiliating of all was the inevitable plague
of vermin. "Hard indeed," one officer was accustomed
to say, "must have been Pharaoh's
heart, and tougher yet his epidermis, if the lice of
the third Egyptian plague were like those of Danville,
and yet he would not 'let Israel go.'" Wearing
the same clothing night and day, sitting on the
bare floors, sleeping there in contact with companions
not over-nice, no patient labor, no exterminating
unguent, afforded much relief. We lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
all squeamishness, all delicacy on the subject, all
inclination for concealment. It was not a returned
Danville prisoner who was reported to have gone
into a drug store in New York stealthily scratching
and saying, "I want some unguentum; don't
want it for myself; only want it for a friend."
But it was reported and believed that in April one
of them entered an apothecary shop in Annapolis
plying his finger-nails and hurriedly asking,
"Have you any bmsquintum?"&mdash;"From your
manner," answered the courteous druggist, "I
think what you want is unguentum."&mdash;"Yes,
<i>run git 'em</i>; I guess that <i>is</i> the true name."&mdash;"Unguentum,
sir"; said the shopkeeper. "How much
unguentum do you want?"&mdash;"Well, I reckon
about two pound!"&mdash;"My dear sir, two pounds
would kill all the lice in Maryland."&mdash;"Well, I
vow I believe I've got 'em!"</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Robert C. Smith of Baltimore, who
took command of the Danville prisons soon after
our arrival, appeared to be kind-hearted, compassionate,
but woefully destitute of what Mrs.
Stowe calls "faculty." He was of medium height,
spare build, fair complexion, sandy hair, blue
eyes, of slightly stooping figure; on the whole rather
good-looking. He was slow of speech, with a
nasal twang that reminded me of Dr. Horace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Bushnell. His face always wore a sad expression.
He had been a student at Yale in the forties a few
years before me. Once a prisoner himself in our
hands and fairly treated, he sympathized with us.
He had been wounded, shot through the right
shoulder. When I visited on parole the other
Danville prisons in February, a Yankee soldier
was pointed out to me as wearing Colonel Smith's
blood-stained coat, and another was said to be
wearing his vest. I had repeated interviews with
him, in which he expressed regret at not being
able to make us more comfortable. He said more
than once to me, "I have no heart for this business.
It requires a man without any heart to keep a military
prison. I have several times asked to be relieved
and sent to the front." An officer of forceful
executive ability might have procured for us
lumber for benches, more coal or wood for the
stoves, some straw or hay for bedding, blankets or
cast-off clothing for the half naked; possibly a little
food, certainly a supply of reading matter from
the charitably disposed. Single instances of his
compassion I have mentioned. I shall have
occasion to speak of another. But the spectacle
of the hopeless mass of misery in the four Danville
prisons seemed to render him powerless, if not
indifferent. As Mrs. Browning puts it:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">A red-haired child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick in a fever, if you touch him once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though but so little as with a finger-tip,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You could as soon weep for the rule of three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or compound fractions!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Like too many officers both Union and Confederate,
he was often in liquor; liquor was always in him.
This "knight of the rueful countenance," of the
sad heart, the mourning voice, the disabled right
arm, and the weakness for apple-jack!&mdash;his only
hope was to have an exchange of prisoners; but
Lincoln and Stanton and Grant would not consent
to that. The last I heard of him was when a letter
of his was shown me by Lieutenant Washington, a
Confederate, a distant relative of the great George.
In it Smith, who had been absent a week from
Danville, complained that he had had "no liquor
for three days," and that he was "painfully
sober"!</p>

<p>"Necessity," says the old apothegm, "is the
mother of invention." It was surprising, how
much we accomplished in a few weeks towards
making ourselves comfortable. Bone or wood was
carved into knives, forks, spoons, buttons, finger-rings,
masonic or army badges, tooth-picks, bosom
pins, and other ornaments; corn-cobs were made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
into smoking pipes; scraps of tin or sheet-iron
were fashioned into plates for eating or dishes for
cooking; shelves were made by tying long wood
splinters together; and many "spittoons," which
were soon rendered superfluous, because the two
entire rooms were transformed into vast spittoons,
were inverted, and made useful as seats which we
called sofas.</p>

<p>Many ingeniously wrought specimens of Yankee
ingenuity were sold clandestinely to the rebel
guards, who ventured to disobey strict orders. No
skinflint vender of wooden nutmegs, leather
pumpkin-seeds, horn gunflints, shoe-peg oats,
huckleberry-leaf tea, bass-wood cheeses, or white-oak
hams, ever hankered more for a trade. Besides
the products of our prison industry, they craved
watches, rings, gold chains, silver spurs, gilt
buttons, genuine breast-pins, epaulets; anything
that was not manufactured in the Confederacy.
Most of all, they longed for greenbacks in exchange
for rebel currency. So in one way or another many
of us contrived to get a little money of some sort.
With it we could buy of the sutler, who visited us
from time to time, rice, flour, beans, bacon, onions,
dried apple, red peppers, sorghum syrup, vinegar,
etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best result of our engaging in handicraft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
work was the relief from unspeakable depression
of spirits. Some of us saw the importance of
making diversion on a large scale. To this end we
planned to start a theatre. Major Wm. H. Fry,
of the 16th Pa. Cavalry, who knew all about
vaudeville in Philadelphia, was a wise adviser.
Young Gardner, who had been an actor, heartily
joined in the movement. I procured a worn-out
copy of Shakespeare. It seemed best to begin with
the presentation of the first act in <i>Hamlet</i>. Colonel
Smith and other rebel officers promised to aid us.
We assigned the parts and commenced studying
and rehearsing. Gardner was to be Hamlet;
Lieut.-Col. Theodore Gregg, 45th Pa., was to be
Claudius, the usurping king; the smooth-faced
Capt. William Cook was to be the queen-mother
Gertrude; Capt. W. F. Tiemann, 159th N. Y.,
was to personate Marcellus; Lieut. C. H. Morton
of Fairhaven, Mass., I think, was Horatio; and
I, having lost about forty pounds of flesh since my
capture&mdash;it was thought most appropriate that I
should be the Ghost! Every morning for some
weeks on the empty first floor we read and rehearsed,
and really made fine progress. But when
we got ready to produce in theatric style, with slight
omissions, the first act, the rebels seemed suspicious
of some ulterior design. They refused to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
furnish a sword for Hamlet, a halberd for Marcellus,
muskets for Bernardo and Francisco, a calico
gown for the queen, or even a white shirt for the
Ghost. This was discouraging. When the lovely
queen-mother Gertrude appealed to her son&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">he answered, "I swear I can't do it!" One
November morning, as we were rehearsing and
shivering on the windy first floor, he ejaculated
with some emphasis, and with ungentle expletives
not found in the original text,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I move, Colonel, that we 'bust up' this
theatre." So the "legitimate drama" vanished
from Danville.</p>

<p>About this time my copy of the Greek New
Testament was stolen from me, an instance, perhaps,
of piety run mad.</p>

<p>A week or two before this, the lower room, in
which I then lodged, containing about a hundred
and seventy officers, was getting into such a
condition that I felt it my duty to call a meeting
to see what measures could be adopted to promote
comfort and decency. I was not the senior in
rank, but Colonel Carle did not feel himself authorized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to issue orders. Some sort of government
must be instituted at once. Nearly all recognized
the necessity of prompt action and strict discipline.
A committee was appointed consisting of myself,
Major John W. Byron, 88th N. Y., and another
officer whose name escapes me, to draw up rules
and regulations. We presented the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">RULES UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED IN THE LOWER ROOM,<br />
DANVILLE, VA., PRISON, OCT. 26, 1864:</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<ol><li>The room shall be thoroughly policed (swept,
etc.) four times each day by the messes in
succession; viz., at sunrise and sunset, and
immediately after breakfast and dinner.</li>

<li>There shall be no washing in this room.</li>

<li>No emptying slops into spittoons.</li>

<li>No washing in the soup buckets or water buckets.</li>

<li>No shaking of clothes or blankets in this room.</li>

<li>No cooking inside the stoves.</li>

<li>No loitering in the yard to the inconvenience of
others.</li>

<li>No person shall be evidently filthy or infested
with vermin.</li>

<li>No indecent, profane, or ungentlemanly language
in this room.</li>

<li>No conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman
about these premises.</li>

<li>No talking aloud at night after nine o'clock.</li>

<li>An officer of the day shall be appointed daily by
the senior officer, whose duty shall be to see
that these rules are strictly enforced, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
report to the senior officer any violation
thereof.</li>

<li>In case of any alleged violation of any of these rules,
the senior officer of the room shall appoint a
Court<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to consist of thirteen disinterested
officers, who shall fairly try and determine the
matter, and in case of conviction the offender's
rations shall be stopped, or the commander of
the prison be requested to confine the offender
in a cell according to the sentence of the Court;
and it shall be the duty of every officer to
have such offender court-martialed after rejoining
his command.<br /><br />For the Committee. H. B. Sprague, Oct, 26, 1864.</li></ol>
</div>

<p>The prison commandant promised that he would
execute any sentence short of capital punishment.
But one case was tried by such court. The offense
was a gross violation of rule 9. The culprit was let
off with a sharp reprimand by General Hayes; but
my first act after the exchange of prisoners was
to prefer charges and specifications against him.
The beast was court-martialed at Annapolis in the
latter part of July, '65.</p>

<p>The observance of these rules wrought wonders
in correcting evils which had become almost unendurable,
and in promoting cheerfulness, good
behavior, and mutual esteem.</p>

<p>Many letters were written to us. Few of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
reached their destination. The first I received
was from Miss Martha Russell, a lady of fine literary
ability, a friend of Edgar A. Poe, living at
North Branford, Conn. In raising my company
(Co. H., 13th Conn.), I had enlisted her brother
Alfred. Under strict military discipline he had
become a valuable soldier, and I had appointed
him my first sergeant. At the battle of Irish
Bend, La., in which I was myself wounded, he
was shot through the neck. The wound seemed
mortal, but I secured special care for him, and his
life was spared as by miracle. His sister's letter
brought a ray of sunshine to several of us. It
assured us that we were tenderly cared for at
home. She quoted to cheer us the fine lines of
the Cavalier poet Lovelace,</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stone walls do not a prison make,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor iron bars a cage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minds innocent and quiet take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That for a hermitage.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A well-grounded conviction prevailed among the
prisoners that the Confederate government was
anxious to secure an exchange of prisoners, but
that the Federal government would not consent.
The reason was evident enough. The Confederate
prisoners in the North, as a rule, were fit for military
duty; the Union prisoners in the South were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
physically unfit. A general exchange would have
placed at once, say, more than forty thousand
fresh soldiers in the rebel ranks, but very few in
ours. Conscription for military service had been
tried in the North with results so bitter that it
seemed unwise to attempt it again. Better let the
unfortunates in southern prisons perish in silence&mdash;that
appeared the wisest policy. But to us prisoners
it appeared a mistake and gross neglect of duty.
Between our keen sense of the wrong in allowing us
to starve, and our love for Lincoln and the Union,
there was a struggle. Our patriotism was put to
the test on the day of the Presidential election,
Tuesday, November 8th. Discouraging as was the
outlook for us personally, we had confidence in the
government and in the justice of our cause. Pains
was taken to obtain a full and fair vote in the
officers' prison. There were two hundred seventy-six
for Lincoln; ninety-one for McClellan. Under
the circumstances the result was satisfactory.</p>

<p>Very earnest, if not acrimonious, were the discussions
that immediately preceded and followed.
Some of us realized their importance, not so much
in arriving at a correct decision on the questions
at issue, as in preventing mental stagnation likely
to result in imbecility if not actual idiocy. By
the stimulus of employment of some kind we must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fight against the apathy, the hopeless loss of will
power, into which several of our comrades seemed
sinking. Mrs. Browning well says:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Get leave to work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this world,&mdash;'tis the best you get at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">... Get work; get work;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be sure 'tis better than what you work to get!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of us started historical debates, and new
views were presented which furnished both amusement
and instruction. One colonel, more redoubtable
in battle than in dialectics, who had been
shot through from breast to back, gravely informed
us that the geometer Euclid was an early English
writer! A kindly visitor, Dr. Holbrook, made me
a present of Hitchcock's <i>Elementary Geology</i>. It
was not quite up to date, having been published
about twenty-five years before, but I found the
study interesting. Grieved at having lost from
my books three years in military service, I endeavored
with three or four companions to make up
for the deficiency by taking lessons in French.
Our teacher was Captain Cook, already mentioned
as teaching us French at Salisbury. As we had no
books, the instruction was oral. I was delighted to
observe how much a knowledge of Latin facilitated
the acquisition of the modern tongue. A few
weeks later upon the arrival of Major George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Haven Putnam, Adjutant at that time of the
176th N. Y., several of us commenced under
him the study of German. Here too the teaching
was oral; but I was able to buy Oehlschl&auml;ger's
<i>German Reader</i>; took special pleasure in memorizing
some of the selections, particularly from the
poets Gleim, Claudius, Goethe, Schiller, and Uhland;
and I was already familiar with some stanzas
of Arndt's noble <i>The German Fatherland</i>, sung so
often to me by my Lieutenant Meisner, slain by my
side in battle. Some of those songs still ring in
my ears. General Hayes, Major Putnam, and two
or three others took lessons in Spanish from a
native of Mexico, 2d Lieut. John Gayetti (I think
that was his name), of Battery B, 2d Pa. Artillery.</p>

<p>Checkerboards and chessboards were prepared
from the rudest materials, and many were the
games with which some of our comrades sought to
beguile the weary hours. Capt. Frank H. Mason
of the 12th Cavalry had the reputation of being
our best chess player and young Adjutant Putnam
was his most persistent opponent.</p>

<p>No one needs to be told that old soldiers are
great story-tellers, drawing upon their imagination
for facts. This talent was assiduously
cultivated in our prison.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>Exact Record of Rations in Danville&mdash;Opportunity to Cook&mdash;Daily
Routine of Proceedings from Early Dawn till Late
at Night.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> imprisonment at Danville lasted from
October 20, '64, to February 17, '65, one hundred
and twenty days. I kept a careful daily record of
the rations issued to us, as did also Lieut. Watson
W. Bush, 2d N. Y. "Mounted Rifles." After
our removal from Danville to Richmond for exchange,
we compared our memoranda, and found
they substantially agreed. During the one hundred
and twenty days the issues were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde"><i>Bread.</i> A loaf every morning. It was made of
unsifted corn-meal, ground "cobs and all." Pieces
several inches in length of cobs unground were sometimes
contained in it. It always seemed wholesome,
though moist, almost watery. Its dimensions
were a little less than 7 inches long, 3 or 4 wide, and
3 thick. I managed to bring home a loaf, and we were
amazed at the shrinkage to a quarter of its original
size. It had become very hard. We broke it in two,
and found inside what appeared to be a dishcloth!</p>

<p class="inde"><i>Meat.</i> Forty-three times. I estimated the weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
at from 2 to 5 or 6 ounces. In it sometimes were
hides, brains, heads, tails, jaws with teeth, lights,
livers, kidneys, intestines, and nameless portions of the
animal economy.</p>

<p class="inde"><i>Soup.</i> Sixty-two times; viz., bean soup forty-seven
times; cabbage nine times; gruel six. It was the thinnest
decoction of small black beans, the slightest
infusion of cabbage, or the most attenuated gruel of
corn-cob meal, that a poetic imagination ever dignified
with the name of <i>soup</i>!</p>

<p class="inde"><i>Potatoes.</i> Seven times. Seldom was one over an
inch in diameter.</p>

<p class="inde"><i>Salt fish.</i> Five times. They call it "hake." It
was good. "Hunger the best sauce."</p>

<p class="inde"><i>Sorghum syrup.</i> Three times. It was known as
"corn-stalk molasses." It was not bad.</p></div>

<p>Nothing else was given us for food by the Confederates
at Danville. The rations appeared to
deteriorate and diminish as the winter advanced.
My diary shows that in the fifty-three days after
Christmas we received meat only three times.</p>

<p>Manifestly such supplies are insufficient to sustain
life very long. By purchase from the rebel sutler
who occasionally visited us, or by surreptitious
trading with the guards, we might make additions
to our scanty allowance. I recollect that two
dollars of irredeemable treasury notes would buy
a gill of rice or beans or corn, a turnip, onion,
parsnip, or small pickled cucumber!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The Confederate cooking needed to be supplemented.
Here the cylinder coal-stoves were
made useful. The tops of them were often covered
with toasting corn bread. Tin pails and iron
kettles of various capacities, from a pint to several
quarts, suspended from the top by wooden hooks
a foot or two in length, each vessel resting against
the hot stove and containing rice, beans, Indian
corn, dried apple, crust coffee, or other delicacy
potable or edible slowly preparing, made the whole
look like a big black chandelier with pendants.
We were rather proud of our prison cuisine. Cooking
was also performed on and in an old worn-out
cook-stove, which a few of our millionaires, forming
a joint-stock company for the purpose, had
bought for two hundred Confederate dollars late in
the season, and which the kind prison commander
had permitted them to place near the southwest
end of the upper room, running the pipe out of a
window. Culinary operations were extensively
carried on also in the open yard outside, about
forty feet by twenty, at the northeast end of the
building. Here the officer would build a diminutive
fire of chips or splinters between bricks, and
boil or toast or roast his allowance. We were
grouped in messes of five to ten or twelve each.
Happy the club of half a dozen that could get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
money enough and a big enough kettle to have
their meal prepared jointly.</p>

<p>Such was the case with my own group after the
lapse of about two months. We had been pinched;
but one morning Captain Cook came to me with
radiant face and said: "Colonel, I have good
news for you. <i>I</i>'m going to run this mess. My
folks in New York have made arrangement with
friends in England to supply me with money, and
I've just received through the lines a hundred
dollars. We'll live like fighting-cocks!" Adjt.
J. A. Clark, 17th Pa. Cav., was our delighted cook.
Shivering for an hour over the big kettle amid the
ice and snow of the back yard, he would send up
word, "Colonel, set the table for dinner." To
"set the table" consisted in sweeping a space six
or eight feet square, and depositing there the
plates, wood, tin, or earthen (mine was of wood;
it had cost me a week's labor in carving). The
officers already mentioned, Cook, Clark, Bush,
Sprague, with Lieut. E. H. Wilder, 9th N. Y.
Cav., sit around in the elegant Turkish fashion, or
more classical recline like the ancients in their
symposia, each resting on his left elbow, with face
as near as possible to the steaming kettle, that not
a smell may be lost!</p>

<p>Wood was scarce. It was used with most rigid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
economy. Many joists overhead had been sawed
off by Lieut. Lewis R. Titus of the <i>Corps D'Afrique</i>,
using a notched table-knife for a saw. In this
way the Vermont Yankee obtained pieces for
cooking, but he weakened the structure till some
officers really feared the roof might come tumbling
about our heads; and I remember that the prison
commandant, visiting the upper room and gazing
heavenward, more than once ejaculated irreverently
the name of the opposite region!</p>

<p>Through the kindness of a Confederate officer
or bribing the guards a log four or five feet in
length is sometimes brought in. Two or three
instantly attack it with a blunt piece of iron hoop
to start the cleaving, and in less time than one
could expect such a work to be done with axes it
is split fine with wooden wedges.</p>

<p>Naturally one of the ever-recurring topics
of discussion was the glorious dishes we could
prepare, if we but had the materials, or of which
we would partake if we ever got home again.
In our memorandum books we are careful to
note down the street and number of the most
famous restaurant in each of the largest cities,
like Delmonico's in New York or Young's in
Boston.</p>

<p>With few exceptions one day is like another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
At earliest dawn each of the two floors is covered
with about a hundred and seventy-five prostrate
forms of officers who have been trying to sleep.
Soon some one of them calls in a loud voice.
"<i>Buckets for water!</i>" The call is repeated. Five
or six, who have predetermined to go early to
the river Dan that seemed nearly a quarter of a
mile distant, start up and seize large wooden
pails. They pass to the lower floor. One of
them says to the sentinel on duty at the southwest
corner door, "Sentry, call the sergeant of the
guard; we want to go for water." He complies.
In five, ten, or fifteen minutes, a non-commissioned
officer, with some half a dozen heavily armed
soldiers, comes, the bolts slide, the doors swing,
our squad passes out. They are escorted down
the hill to the river, and back to prison. By this
time it is broad daylight. Many are still lying
silent on the floor. Most have risen. Some are
washing, or rather wiping with wet handkerchief,
face and hands; others are preparing to cook,
splitting small blocks of wood for a fire of splinters;
a few are nibbling corn bread; here and there one
is reading the New Testament. There is no change
or adjustment of clothing, for the night dress is the
same as the day dress. We no longer wonder how
the cured paralytic in Scripture could obey the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
command, "Take up thy bed and walk"; for at
heaviest the bed is but a blanket!</p>

<p>Now, for a half-hour, vengeance on vermin
that have plagued us during the night! We daily
solve the riddle of the fishermen's answer to
"What luck?" the question which puzzled to
death</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">"The blind old bard of Scio's rocky isle,"</p>

<p class="center">"<i>As many as we caught we left; as many as we could
not catch we carry with us</i>!"</p></div>

<p>About eight o'clock the cry is heard from the
southwest end of the room, "Fall in for roll-call!
fall in!" to which several would impudently add,
"Here he comes! here he is!" A tall, slim, stooping,
beardless, light-haired phenomenon, known as
"the roll-call sergeant," enters with two musketeers.
We officers having formed in two ranks
on the northwest side of the room, he passes
down the front from left to right slowly counting.
Setting down the number in a memorandum
book, he commands in a squeaky feminine voice,
"Break ranks," which most of us have already
done. Much speculation arose as to the nature
and status of this singular being. His face was
smooth and childlike, yet dry and wrinkled, so
that it was impossible to tell whether he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fifteen or fifty. A committee was said to have
waited upon him, and with much apparent deference
asked him as to his nativity, his age, and
whether he was human or divine, married or single,
man or woman. They said he answered sadly,
"Alas! I'm no angel, but a married man, thirty-seven
years old, from South Carolina. I have
three children who resemble me."</p>

<p>Immediately after roll-call, corn bread is brought
in for breakfast. It is in large squares about two
feet in length and breadth, the top of each square
being marked for cutting into twenty or twenty-five
rations. Colonel Hooper and Capt. D. Tarbell
receive the whole from the rebel commissary, and
then distribute to each mess its portion. The
mess commissary endeavors to cut it into equal
oblong loaves. To make sure of a fair distribution,
one officer turns his back, and one after another
lays his hand upon a loaf and asks, "Whose is
this?" The officer who has faced about names
some one as the recipient.</p>

<p>Clear the way now for sweepers. From one
end of the room to the other they ply their coarse
wooden brooms. Some officers are remarkably
neat, and will scrape their floor space with pieces
of glass from the broken windows; a few are listless,
sullen, utterly despondent, regardless of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
surroundings, apparently sinking into imbecility;
the majority are taking pains to keep up an
appearance of respectability.</p>

<p>Many who have been kept awake through the
night by cold or rheumatism now huddle around
the stoves and try to sleep. Most of the remainder,
as the weeks pass, glide into something like
a routine of occupations. For several weeks I
spent an hour or two every day carving with a
broken knife-blade a spoon from a block of hard
wood. Sporadic wood-splitting is going on, and
cooking appears to be one of the fine arts. An
hour daily of oral exercises in French, German,
Spanish, Latin, or Italian, under competent
teachers, after the Sauveur or Berlitz method,
amused and to some extent instructed many.
Our cavalry adjutant, Dutch Clark, so called from
his skill in the "Pennsylvania Dutch" dialect
made perhaps a hundred familiar with the morning
salutation, "<i>Haben Sie gut geschlafen?</i>" ("Have
you slept well?") Lieut. Henry Vander Weyde,
A. D. C., 1st Div., 6th Corps, the artist chum of
our principal German instructor, amused many by
his pencil portraits of "Slim Jim," the nondescript
"roll-call sergeant" of uncertain age and gender;
also of some of the sentries, and one or two of his
fellow prisoners. A worn-out pack of fifty-two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
cards, two or three chess and checker boards of
our manufacture, and twenty-four rudely carved
checker-men and thirty-two fantastic chess-men,
furnished frequent amusement to those who understood
the games.</p>

<p>On an average once in two days we received
about one o'clock what was called soup. We
were told, and we believed it to be true, that all
the rich nitrogenous portion had been carefully
skimmed off for use elsewhere; not thrown away
as the fresh maid threw the "scum" that formed
on top of the milk!</p>

<p>The topic of most frequent discussion was the
prospect of an exchange of prisoners. Our would-be
German conversationalists never forgot to
ask, "<i>Haben Sie etwas geh&ouml;rten von Auswechseln der
Gefangenen?</i>" ("Have you heard anything of
exchange of prisoners?") It was hard to believe
that our government would leave us to die of
starvation.</p>

<p>At the close of the soup hour and after another
turn at sweeping, almost every officer again sat
down or sat up to rid himself of the <i>pediculid&aelig; vestimenti</i>.
We called it "skirmishing"; it was rather
a pitched battle. The humblest soldier and the
brevet major-general must daily strip and fight.
Ludicrous, were it not so abominable, was this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
mortifying necessity. No account of prison life
in Danville would be complete without it. Pass
by it hereafter in sorrow and silence, as one of
those duties which Cicero says are to be done
but not talked about.</p>

<p>The occupations of the morning are now largely
resumed, but many prefer to lie quiet on the floor
for an hour.</p>

<p>An interesting incident that might happen at
any time is the arrival in prison of a Confederate
newspaper. A commotion near the stairway!
Fifty or a hundred cluster around an officer with a
clear strong voice, and listen as he reads aloud
the news, the editorials, and the selections. The
rebels are represented as continually gaining
victories, but singularly enough the northern
armies are always drawing nearer!</p>

<p>Toward sunset many officers walk briskly half an
hour to and fro the length of the room for exercise.</p>

<p>Another roll-call by the mysterious heterogeneous
if not hermaphroditical Carolina sergeant!</p>

<p>Brooms again by the mess on duty. Again
oral language-lessons by Cook and Putnam. Then
discussions or story-telling.</p>

<p>It is growing dark. A candle is lighted making
darkness visible. We have many skilful singers,
who every evening "discourse most excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
music." They sing <i>Just before the battle, mother;
Do they miss me at home? We shall meet, but
we shall miss him</i> (a song composed on the death
of one of my Worcester pupils by Hon. Charles
Washburn); <i>Nearer, My God, to thee</i>, etc. From
the sweet strains of affection or devotion, which
suffuse the eyes as we begin to lie down for the
night, the music passes to the <i>Star-spangled Banner</i>,
<i>Rally round the flag</i>, <i>John Brown's body lies
a'mouldering in the grave</i>, and the like. Often the
"concert" concludes with a comic Dutch song by
Captain Cafferty, Co. D, 1st N. Y. Cav.</p>

<p>Sleep begins to seal many eyelids, when someone
with a loud voice heard through the whole
room starts a series of sharp critical questions,
amusing or censorious, thus:</p>

<p class="pad1">"Who don't skirmish?" This is answered
loudly from another quarter.</p>

<p>"Slim Jim." The catechism proceeds, sometimes
with two or three distinct responses.</p>

<p>"Who cheats the graveyard?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Sprague."</p>

<p>"Who sketched Fort Darling?"</p>

<p>"Captain Tripp." (He was caught sketching
long before, and was refused exchange.)</p>

<p>"Who never washes?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lieutenant Screw-my-upper-jaw-off." (His was
an unpronounceable foreign name.)</p>

<p>"Who knows everything?"</p>

<p>"General Duffi&eacute;." (Duffi&eacute; was a brave officer,
of whom more anon.)</p>

<p>"Who don't know anything?"</p>

<p class="pad2">"The fools that talk when they should be
asleep." (The querists subside at last.)</p>

<p>For warmth we lie in contact with each other
"spoon-fashion," in groups of three or more. I
had bought a heavy woolen shawl for twenty
Confederate dollars, and under it were Captain
Cook, Adjutant Clark, and Lieutenant Wilder; I
myself wearing my overcoat, and snuggling up to
my friend Cook. All four lay as close as possible
facing in the same direction. The night wears
slowly away. When the floor seemed intolerably
hard, one of us would say aloud, "Spoon!" and
all four would flop over, and rest on the other side.
So we vibrated back and forth from nine o'clock
till dawn. We were not comfortable, but in far
better circumstances than most of the prisoners.
Indeed Captain Cook repeatedly declared he owed
his life to our blanket.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>Continual Hope of Exchange of Prisoners&mdash;"Flag-of-Truce
Fever!"&mdash;Attempted Escape by Tunneling&mdash;Repeated
Escapes by Members of Water Parties, and how we Made
the Roll-Call Sergeant's Count Come Out all Right every
Time&mdash;Plot to Break Out by Violence, and its Tragic End.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> principal hope for relief from the increasing
privations of prison life and from probable
exhaustion, sickness, and death, lay in a
possible exchange of prisoners. A belief was
prevalent that the patients in hospital would be
the first so favored. Hence strenuous efforts were
sometimes made to convince the apothecary
whom we called doctor, and who often visited
us, that a prisoner was ill enough to require
removal. Once in the institution, the patients got
better food, something like a bed, medical attendance
daily, and a more comfortable room. Some
of them were shamming, lying in two senses and
groaning when the physicians were present, but
able to sit up and play euchre the rest of the day
and half the night. This peculiar disease, this
eagerness to get into hospital or remain there till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
exchanged by flag of truce, was known as the
"flag-of-truce fever" or "flag-of-truce-on-the-brain!"</p>

<p>I recall one striking instance. Lieutenant Gardner,
already mentioned, had received six or eight
hundred dollars in Confederate currency as the
price of a gold watch. But like the prodigal in
Scripture he was now in a far country, and had
wasted his substance in what he called "righteous"
living. And when he had spent all, there arose
a mighty famine in that corner of the lower room,
and he began to be in want. And he would fain
have filled his belly with corn-cob-meal bread, or
spoiled black beans, or the little potatoes which
the swine didn't eat. And no man gave him
enough. And he determined to go to hospital.
He gave out that he was desperately sick. I at
this time had "quarters" on the floor above.
Word was brought to me that my friend was mortally
ill, and would thank me to come down and
take his last message to his relatives. Alarmed, I
instantly went down. I found him with two or
three splitting a small log of wood!</p>

<p class="pad1">"Gardner, I hear you are a little 'under the
weather.'"</p>

<p>"Dying, Colonel, dying!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"What appears to be your disease?"</p>

<p>"Flag-o'-truce-on-the-brain!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you've got the exchange fever?"</p>

<p>"Yes; bad."</p>

<p>"Pulse run high?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred a minute."</p>

<p>"Anything I can do for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel, beseech that fool doctor to send
me to hospital. Tell him I'm on my last legs.
Tell him I only want to die there. Appeal to him
in behalf of my poor wife and babies." (Gardner,
as I well knew, was a bachelor, and had no children&mdash;to
speak of.)</p>

<p>"Well, Lieutenant, I'll do anything I properly
can for you. Is there anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel; lend me your overcoat to wear
to hospital; I'll send it back at once."</p>

<p>"But, Lieutenant, you can't get into the hospital.
Your cheeks are too rosy; you're the picture of
health."</p>

<p class="pad2">"I'm glad you mentioned that, Colonel. I'll fix
that. You'll see."</p>

<p>Next morning he watched at the window, and
when he saw the doctor coming, he swallowed a
large pill of plug tobacco. The effect was more
serious than he expected. In a few minutes he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
became sick in earnest, and was frightened. A
deathlike pallor supervened. When the doctor
reached him, there was a genuine fit of vomiting.
The story runs that Captain Tiemann made a
pathetic appeal in behalf of the imaginary twin
babies, that the doctor diagnosed it as a clear case
of puerperal (which he pronounced "puerp&#275;rial")
fever complicated with symptoms of cholera
infantum, and ordered him to hospital at once!
I loaned the patient my overcoat, which he sent
back directly. His recovery seemed miraculous.
In a week or two he returned from his delightful
outing. This was in the latter part of November.</p>

<p>Previously, for some weeks, Captain Howe and
three or four other strong and determined officers
managed to get into the cellar of a one-story building
contiguous to ours and thence to excavate a
tunnel out beyond the line on which the sentinels
were perpetually pacing to and fro. I was too
feeble to join in the enterprise, but hoped to
improve the opportunity to escape when the work
was done. Unfortunately the arching top of the
tunnel was too near the surface of the ground, and
the thin crust gave way under the weight of a
sentry. He yelled "Murder!" Two or three of
our diggers came scurrying back. The guard
next to him shouted, "You Yanks! you G&mdash;d<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
d&mdash;d Yanks!" and fired into the deep hole. No
more tunneling at Danville.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>More successful and more amusing were several
attempts by individual officers one at a time. The
water parties of four to eight went under a strong
guard two or three times a day down a long hill to
the river Dan. On the slope alongside the path
were a number of large brick ovens,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in which,
we were told, the Confederates used to bake those
big squares of corn bread. The iron doors when
we passed were usually open. On the way back
from the river, one officer on some pretense or
other would lag behind the rearmost soldier of the
guard, who would turn to hurry him up. The next
officer, as soon as the soldier's back was turned,
would dodge into an open oven, and the careless
guards now engaged in a loud and passionate
controversy about slavery or secession would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
miss him! Then, as night came on, the negroes
in the vicinity, who, like all the rest of the colored
people, were friendly to us, would supply the
escaped officer with food and clothing, and pilot
him on his way rejoicing toward the Union lines.
One by one, six officers escaped in that way, and
many of us began to look forward to the time when
our turn would come to try the baking virtues
of those ovens!</p>

<p>But it was important that the escaped officer
should not be missed. How should we deceive the
nondescript that we called "the roll-call sergeant"?
Morning and evening he carefully counted every
one. How make the census tally with the former
enumerations? Yankee ingenuity was here put to
a severe test; but Lieutenant Titus, before mentioned,
solved the problem. With his table-knife
saw he cut a hole about two feet square in the floor
near the northeast corner of the upper room. A
nicely fitting trapdoor completed the arrangement.
Through this hole, helped by a rude rope
ladder of strips of rags, and hoisted to the shoulders
of a tall man by strong arms from below, a
nimble officer could quickly ascend. Now those
in the lower room were counted first. When
they broke ranks, and the human automaton
faced to the west and moved slowly towards the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
stairs with three or four "Yanks" clustering at his
side in earnest conversation, the requisite number
of spry young prisoners would "shin up" the
ladder, emerge, "deploy," and be counted over
again in the upper room! The thing worked to a
charm. Not one of the six was missed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, two or three of them
were recaptured and again incarcerated in Libby.
The Richmond authorities thereupon telegraphed
to Colonel Smith, asking how those officers escaped
from Danville. Smith, surprised, ordered
a recount. The trapdoor did its duty. "All
present!" Finally he answered, "No prisoner has
escaped from Danville." The rebel commissary
of prisons at Richmond, Gen. J. H. Winder, then
telegraphed the names of the recaptured officers.
Smith looks on his books: there are those names,
sure enough! The mystery must be solved. He
now sends his adjutant to count us about noon.
We asked him what it meant. He told us it was
reported that several officers had escaped. We
replied, "That's too good to be true." He
counted very slowly and with extraordinary precision.
He kept his eye on the staircase as he
approached it. Six officers flew up the ladder as
we huddled around him. It was almost impossible
to suppress laughter at the close, when he declared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
"I'll take my oath no prisoner has escaped
from this prison." But there were those names of
the missing, and there was our ill-disguised mirth.
Smith resorted to heroic measures. He came in
with two or three of his staff and a man who was
said to be a professor of mathematics. This was
on the 8th of November, 1864. He made all
officers of the lower room move for a half-hour
into the upper room, and there fall in line with the
rest. His adjutant called the roll in reality.
Each as his name was read aloud was made to step
forward and cross to the other side. Of course no
one could answer for the absent six. I doubt if he
ever learned the secret of that trapdoor. The
professor of mathematics promised to bring me
a Geometry. About two weeks later, November
24th, he brought me a copy of Davies's
<i>Legendre</i>.</p>

<p>On the 9th of December, while our senior officer,
General Hayes, was sick in hospital, the next in
rank, Gen. A. N. Duffi&eacute;, of the First Cavalry
Division of Sheridan's army, fresh from the French
service, with which he had campaigned in Algeria,
where he was wounded nine times, suddenly conceived
a plot to break out and escape. Two companies
of infantry had arrived in the forenoon
and stacked their arms in plain sight on the level<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
ground about twenty rods distant. Duffi&eacute;'s plan
was to rush through the large open door when
a water party returning with filled buckets should
be entering, seize those muskets, overpower the
guard, immediately liberate the thousand or
fifteen hundred Union prisoners in the three other
Danville prisons, and push off to our lines in East
Tennessee. He had Sheridan's <i>&eacute;lan</i>, not Grant's
cool-headed strategy. With proper preparation
and organization, such as Hayes would have
insisted upon, it might have been a success. He
called us, field officers about twenty, together and
laid the matter before us. No vote was taken, but
I think a majority were opposed to the whole
scheme. He was disposed to consider himself,
though a prisoner, as still vested with authority to
command all of lower rank, and he expected them
to obey him without question. In this view
many acquiesced, but others dissented. By his
request, though doubtful of his right to command
and in feeble health, I drew up a pledge for those
to sign who were willing to engage in the projected
rising and would promise to obey. It was found
that at least one hundred and fifty could be
counted on. Colonel Ralston, previously mentioned,
was the chief opponent of the outbreak, but
he recognized Duffi&eacute;'s authority and insisted upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
our submission to it. Similar appeared to be the
attitude of the following colonels:</p>

<p>Gilbert H. Prey, 104th N. Y.</p>
<p>James Carle, 191st Pa.</p>
<p>T. B. Kaufman, 209th Pa.</p>
<p>W. Ross Hartshorne, 190th Pa.</p>

<p>Of the lieutenant-colonels, most of the following
doubted the success, but would do their best to
promote it, if commanded:</p>

<p>Charles H. Tay, 10th N. J.</p>
<p>Theodore Gregg, 45th Pa.</p>
<p>G. A. Moffett, 94th N. Y.</p>
<p>J. S. Warner, 121st Pa.</p>
<p>George Hamett, 147th N. Y.</p>
<p>Charles H. Hooper, 24th Mass.</p>
<p>Homer B. Sprague, 13th Conn.</p>

<p>So the following majors: A. W. Wakefield, 49th
Pa.; G. S. Horton, 58th Mass.; E. F. Cooke, 2d
N. Y. Cav.; John G. Wright, 51st N. Y.; J. V.
Peale, 4th Pa. Cav.; John W. Byron, 88th N. Y.;
David Sadler, 2d Pa. Heavy Art.; John Byrne,
155th N. Y.; E. O. Shepard, 32d Mass.; J. A.
Sonders, 8th Ohio Cav.; Charles P. Mattocks,
17th Maine; E. S. Moore, Paymaster; Wm. H.
Fry, 16th Pa. Cav.; Milton Wendler, 191st Pa.;
James E. Deakins, 8th Tenn. Cav.; Geo. Haven
Putnam, Adjt. and later Bvt.-Major, 176th N. Y.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>All of the foregoing then present and not on the
sick list should have been most thoroughly instructed
as to their duties, and should have been enabled
to communicate all needed information to the
forty-six captains and one hundred and thirty-three
lieutenants, who, though many were sadly reduced
in vitality, were accounted fit for active service. I
had repeatedly noticed in battle the perplexity of
company, regimental, or even brigade commanders,
from lack of information as to the necessary movements
in unforeseen emergencies. It is not enough to
say, as one corps commander (Hancock?) is said to
have done during the Battle of the Wilderness in
May, 1864, to a newly arrived colonel with his regiment,
who inquired, "Where shall I go in?" "Oh,
anywhere; there's lovely fighting all along the line!"</p>

<p>Here the step most vital to success, the <i>sine qua
non</i>, was to keep that outside door open for the
outrush of two hundred men. To this end, eight
of our strongest and most determined, under a
dashing leader like Colonel Hartshorne or Lieutenant-Colonel
Gregg, should have been sent out
as a water party. Instead, Captain Cook, who
was brave enough, but then physically weak,
hardly able to carry a pail of water, was the leader
of an average small squad, "the spirit indeed
willing, but the flesh weak."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly less important was it to select a dozen
or twenty of the most fierce and energetic, to be
at the head of the stairs in perfect readiness to
dash instantly through the opening door and
assist the water party in disarming their guards,
and, without a moment's pause, followed by the
whole two hundred, pounce upon the guard house.
Ralston or Duffi&eacute; himself should have headed
this band. Simultaneously, without a second's
interval, three or four desperate, fiery, powerful
officers, detailed for the purpose, should have
grappled with the sentinel on duty in the middle
of the lower room and disarmed and gagged him.</p>

<p>Besides the field officers, we had with us many
subordinates of great intelligence like Capt.
Henry S. Burrage of the 36th Mass., Lieut. W. C.
B. Goff of the 1st D. C. Cav., Lieut. W. C.
Howe, 2d Mass. Cav., Adjt. James A. Clark, 17th
Pa. Cav., and the artist, Lieut. Henry Vander
Weyde; and nothing would have been easier than
for Duffi&eacute; to communicate through them to every
officer the most complete and precise information
and instructions.</p>

<p>Scarcely any of these precautions were taken.
The general was impatient. The next day, December
10th, he issued his command in these words: "I
order the attempt to be made, and I call upon all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of you, who have not forgotten how to obey orders,
to follow." The water party was immediately
sent out, and its return was watched for. He and
Ralston, without the help of a third, made the
mistake of personally grappling with the floor
sentry, a brave, strong, red-headed fellow, and
they tackled him a moment too soon. He stoutly
resisted. They wrested his musket from him.
He yelled. They tried to stop his mouth. Instantly
the door began to swing open a little.
The water party, too few and too weak, paralyzed,
failed to act. The foremost of us sprang from the
stairs to the door. Before we could reach it, it was
slammed to, bolted and barred against us! With
several others I rushed to the windows and tried to
tear off the heavy bars. In vain. The soldiers
outside began firing through the broken panes.
Ralston was shot through the body. We assisted
him up the stairs while the bullets were flying.
In less than five minutes from the moment when
he and Duffi&eacute; seized the sentinel, it was all over.
In about a quarter of an hour, Colonel Smith came
in with his adjutant and two or three guards, and
ordered Ralston removed to hospital. As he was
carried out, one of us expressed the hope that
the wound was not serious. He answered in the
language of Mercutio, "No, 'tis not so deep as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough,
'twill serve." He knew it was mortal, and
expressed a willingness to die for his country in the
line of duty. He passed away next morning.
Colonel Smith expressed sorrow for him, and surprise
at the ingratitude of us who had been guilty
of insurrection against his gentle sway!</p>

<p>A strict search for possible weapons followed
during which we were told we must give up our
United States money. I saved a ten-dollar greenback
by concealing it in my mouth "as an ape
doth nuts in the corner of his jaw," all the while
munching corn bread, gnawing two holes in the bill!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>Kind Clergymen Visit us and Preach Excellent Discourses&mdash;Colonel
Smith's Personal Good Will to me&mdash;His Offer&mdash;John
F. Ficklin's Charity&mdash;My Good Fortune&mdash;Supplies of

<p><span class="smcap">Union</span> men never looked upon Confederates
as mortal enemies. Whenever a flag of truce
was flying, both were disposed to shake hands
and exchange favors. I recollect that our Captain
Burrage complained that he was unfairly
captured when he was engaged in a friendly deal
with a Confederate between the lines. At Port
Hudson, when the white signal was to go down, we
gave the "Johnnies" fair warning, shouting,
"<span class="smcapl">RATS! TO YOUR HOLES!</span>" before we fired on them.
But war cannot be conducted on peace principles,
and in a flash a man acts like a devil. In an open
window near the spot where I slept, an officer upset
a cup of water, and a few drops fell on the head
of the guard outside. Instantly he fired. The
bullet missed, passed through the window below
and the floor above, and lodged in the hand or arm
of another officer. I had an opportunity to express<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to Colonel Smith my angry disgust at such savagery.
He agreed that the fellow ought to be
punished&mdash;"at least for not being able to shoot
straighter!"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Kindly visits were sometimes paid us. Two
young men from the Richmond Young Men's
Christian Association came. The wicked said,
"One came 'to pray with us all right,' the other
'to prey upon us all wrong'"; for the latter tried
to induce us to exchange greenbacks for rebel
currency!</p>

<p>Several times we were visited by kind clergymen
who preached excellent sermons. The first
was Rev. &mdash;&mdash; Dame of Danville. He was, I think,
an Episcopal minister. He was a high Mason, a
gentleman of very striking appearance, with a
beautiful flowing beard, that would have done
honor to Moses or Aaron. As we sat on the hard
floor, two hundred listening reverently to his choice
language, he seemed to foresee the doom which
many of us had begun to fear, and he very appropriately
and with much earnestness bade us consider
our latter end. Mentioning his name with gratitude
some thirty years afterwards in a lecture
at the Mountain Lake Chautauqua, Md., one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
my audience gave me a photograph of the minister's
handsome face, and told me he was greatly
beloved. I doubt not he deserved it.</p>

<p>Rev. Charles K. Hall of Danville, a Methodist
Episcopal clergyman, came to us a little later.
His first sermon was an eloquent discourse on
Charity. He practiced what he preached; for he
never came empty-handed. On his first visit he
brought armfuls of tobacco, each plug wrapped in
a pious tract. He asked us to fall in line, for he
had something for each. When he came to me in
the distribution, I declined it, saying "I never
use tobacco in any form." "Oh take it," said he;
"you read the tract, and give the tobacco to your
neighbor." On subsequent Sundays he brought
eggs and other delicacies for the sick. We admired
him as a preacher, and regarded him with affection
as a man. Secession and slavery aside, for he
believed in the rightfulness of both, as we learned
on arguing with him, it would be hard to find a
more lovable character than Charles K. Hall.
And the South was full of such, who would have
been glad, if permitted and opportunity offered,
to be good Samaritans, neighbors to him who had
fallen among foes; pure, gentle, kindly spirits, to
whom it will be said in the last great day, "I was
an hungred and ye gave me meat; I was sick, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto
me."</p>

<p>From the lack of sufficient and proper food,
clothing, and exercise, the health of all suffered.
Much of the time it was impossible to keep warm.
The most prevalent diseases, I think, were
rheumatism and scurvy. I suffered from both.
Anti-scorbutics were scarce. The pain from rheumatism
was slight during the day; but at evening
it began in the joints of the fingers and became
more severe as night advanced, ascending from
the hands to the wrists, arms, and shoulders. It
was worst at midnight and through the small
hours, then gradually diminished till daylight.
The prison physician did his best to help us with
liniment, but in those winter nights the treatment
was ineffective.</p>

<p>Upon the total failure of our attempt to break
out on the 10th of December, and having come
reluctantly to the conclusion that Colonel Smith
had told us the truth when he said that Lincoln
and Grant would not consent to an exchange of
prisoners, I foresaw that death was inevitable after
a few months, perhaps a few weeks, unless the
situation should materially change for the better.
I determined, though without much hope of success,
to appeal to Colonel Smith for personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
favor. On the 15th of December I sent word to
him that I wished an interview with him. He
immediately sent a soldier to bring me to his
office. He received me courteously; for he was a
gentleman. I told him it was necessary for me,
if I was to live much longer, that I should at least
have better food and more of it. I asked him if
it would not be possible for an arrangement to be
effected whereby some of my relatives in the north
should furnish a Confederate prisoner with food,
clothing, and comforts, and that prisoner's relatives
in the south should reciprocate by supplying
me. He answered that it might be possible, but
he did not know of any such southern captive's
friends likely to respond. After a few minutes of
silence he said:</p>

<p>"Colonel Sprague, I'd like to do something for
you, and I'll make you an offer."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Your government has adopted the devilish
policy of no exchange of prisoners."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it's true."</p>

<p>"I know it's true."</p>

<p>"Well, what's your proposition?"</p>

<p>"I am overworked here. I must do my duty to
my government. Our cause is just."</p>

<p>"Well?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to have you assist me by doing
writing regularly for me at these headquarters. I
would parole you. You shall have a room to yourself,
a good bed, plenty of food, and a good deal of
liberty. You must give me your word of honor
not to attempt to escape."</p>

<p>"Colonel Smith, I thank you. I appreciate the
friendly spirit in which you make the offer, and I
am very grateful for it. But I can't conscientiously
accept it. I am in the Union Army, bound
to do everything in my power to destroy your
government. I must do nothing to help it. If
Lincoln refuses to exchange us prisoners, it may
be best for the United States, though hard on us.
What happens to us is a minor matter. It's a
soldier's business to die for his country rather than
help its enemies in the slightest degree. I can't
entertain your proposal."</p>

<p>So the conference ended sadly. As I was leaving
his office he introduced me to a Confederate
soldier who sat there and who had heard the whole
conversation. Next day this soldier entered the
prison by permission of Colonel Smith and brought
me some nice wheat bread, some milk, pickles, and
other food, a pair of thick woolen stockings, and a
hundred dollars in Confederate money. He gave
me his name, John F. Ficklin, of the Virginia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<i>Black Horse Cavalry</i>. He whispered to me that
he was at heart a Union man, but had been forced
by circumstances to enter the Confederate service;
that by simulating illness he had got relieved from
duty at the front and assigned to service at Colonel
Smith's headquarters; that he was confident he
could bring about such an arrangement for reciprocal
supplies as I had proposed, and had so
informed Smith, who approved of the plan; that
until such a plan should be put in operation he
would furnish me from his own table. He said
to me very privately that he was greatly moved by
what I had said the day before. "But," he added,
"I am not entirely unselfish in this. I foresee
that the Confederacy can't last very long; certainly
not a year. I give it till next September;
and, frankly, when it goes to smash, I want to
stand well with you officers." At my suggestion
he gave a few other prisoners food and money.</p>

<p>In a few days I was again called to headquarters
to meet a Mr. Jordan, who, through Ficklin's
efforts, had been invited to meet me. His son,
Henry T. Jordan, Adjutant of the 55th North
Carolina Regiment, was at that time a prisoner
at Johnson's Island, Ohio. Mr. Jordan agreed to
make out a list of articles which he wished my
relatives to send to his son. In a day or two he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
did so. I likewise made out a statement of my
immediate wants, as follows:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wood for cooking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cup, plate, knife, fork, spoon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnips, salt, pepper, rice, vinegar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pickled cucumbers, dried apple, molasses;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any other substantial food.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I asked Jordan to send me those things <i>at once</i>.
He answered after some delay that he would do so
immediately on receiving an acknowledgment
from his son that my friends had furnished him
what he wanted; and he would await such a message!
As my relatives were in Massachusetts and
Connecticut, it would take considerable time for
them to negotiate with the prison commandant
and other parties in Ohio and have the stipulations
distinctly understood and carried into
effect there. Besides, there were likely to be
provoking delays in communicating by mail between
the north and the south, and it might be a
month or six weeks before he got assurances from
his son; by which time I should probably be in a
better world than Danville, and in no need of
wood, food, or table-ware. I wrote him to that
effect, and requested him to make haste, but
received no reply.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. Ficklin came to the rescue. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a pretext to deceive, if need were, the prison
authorities, and furnish to them and others a
sufficient reason for bringing me supplies, he
pretended that he had a friend, a Confederate
prisoner of war at Camp Douglas near Chicago,
and that Colonel Sprague's friends had been
exceedingly kind to him, ministering most liberally
to his wants! The name of this imaginary
friend was J. H. Holland, a private soldier of the
30th Virginia Cavalry. Ficklin forged a letter
purporting to come from Holland to him, which
he showed to Colonel Smith, in which he spoke
with much gratitude of my friends' bounty, and
besought Ficklin to look tenderly after my comfort
in return! The ruse succeeded. Ficklin's generosity
to me was repeated from time to time, and
perhaps saved my life.</p>

<p>A year after the close of the war Ficklin wrote
to me that he wished to secure a position in the
Treasury Department of the United States, and
he thought it would aid him if I would certify
to what I knew of his kindness to Union prisoners.
I accordingly drew up a strong detailed statement
of his timely and invaluable charities to us in our
distress. I accompanied it with vouchers for my
credibility signed by Hon. N. D. Sperry, General
Wm. H. Russell, and President Theodore D.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Woolsey, all of New Haven, and Governor Wm. A.
Buckingham of Norwich, Conn. These documents
I forwarded to Ficklin. I do not know the result.</p>

<p>From Sergeant Wilson F. Smith, chief clerk at
Colonel Smith's headquarters, a paroled prisoner,
member of Co. F., 6th Pa. Cav., the company
of Captain Furness, son or brother of my
Shakespearian friend, Dr. Horace Howard Furness,
and from Mr. Strickland, undertaker, who furnished
the coffins and buried the dead of the
Danville prisons, both of whom I talked with
when I was on parole in February, '65, I obtained
statistics mutually corroborative of the number
of deaths in the Danville prisons. In November
there were 130; in December, 140; from January
1st to January 24th, 105. The negro soldiers suffered
most. There were sixty-four of them living in
prison when we reached Danville, October 20, '64.
Fifty-seven of them were dead on the 12th of
February, '65, when I saw and talked with the seven
survivors in Prison No. Six. From one of the
officers (I think it was Captain Stuart) paroled
like myself in February to distribute supplies
of clothing sent by the United States through the
lines, and who performed that duty in Salisbury,
and from soldiers of my own regiment there
imprisoned, I learned that in the hundred days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ending February 1st, out of eight or ten thousand
prisoners, more than thirty a day, more than
three thousand in all, had died! Of Colonel
Hartshorne's splendid "Bucktail Regiment," the
190th Pa., formerly commanded by my Yale
classmate Colonel O'Neil who fell at Antietam,
there were 330 at Salisbury, October 19th, the
day we left; 116 of them were dead before February
1st, one company losing 22 out of 33 men.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Why this fearful mortality? Men do not die
by scores, hundreds, thousands, without some
extraordinary cause. It was partly for want of
clothing. They were thinly clad when captured.</p>

<p>Pursuant to agreement entered into early in
December, 1864, between the Federal and Confederate
authorities, supplies of clothing for
Union prisoners in Richmond, Danville, and
Salisbury, were sent through the lines. They
did not reach Danville till February. Colonel
Carle, 191st Pa. and myself, with another
officer (I think he was Colonel Gilbert G. Prey,
104th N. Y.) were paroled to distribute coats
(or blouses), trousers, and shoes, among the
enlisted men in their three prisons. Then for the
first time Union officers saw the interior of those
jails. By permission of Colonel Smith, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Ficklin accompanied us on one of these visits, and
I saw him give fifty dollars in Confederate money
to one of our suffering soldiers. My part in the
distribution was to sign as witness opposite the
name of each one receiving. Those rolls should be
in the archives at Washington.</p>

<p>On the 12th of February we issued shoes and
clothing in the jail known as Prison No. Six.
It contained that day 308 of our men. There
were the seven surviving colored soldiers, and the
one wearing our prison commander's coat. We
requested them all to form line, and each as his
name was called to come forward and receive
what he most needed. Some of them were so
feeble that they had to be assisted in coming down
from the upper floor, almost carried in the arms
of stronger comrades. Many were unable to
remain standing long, and sank helpless on the
floor. Nearly all were half-clad, or wearing only
the thinnest of garments. Some were white
with vermin. Several were so far gone that they
had forgotten their company or regiment. Every
one seemed emaciated. Many kept asking me
why our government did not exchange prisoners;
for they were told every day the truth that the
Confederate government desired it. There was
a stove, but no fuel. The big rooms were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
heated. The cold was severe. About a third of
them had apparently given up all hope of keeping
their limbs and bodies warm; but they kept their
heads, necks, shoulders, and chests, carefully
wrapped. The dismal coughing at times drowned
all other sounds, and made it difficult to proceed
with our work of distribution. There were two
little fires of chips and splinters on bricks, one of
them near the middle, the other near the far end.
In contact with these were tin or earthen cups containing
what passed for food or drink. There was
no outlet for smoke. It blackened the hands and
faces of those nearest, and irritated the lungs of all.</p>

<p>This prison was the worst. It was colder than
the others. But all were uncomfortably cold.
All were filled with smoke and lice. From each
there went every day to the hospital a wagon-load
of half-starved and broken-hearted soldiers
who would never return. I visited the hospital
to deliver to two of the patients letters which
Colonel Smith had handed to me for them. They
were both dead. I looked down the long list.
The word "Died," with the date, was opposite
most of the names. As I left the hospital I
involuntarily glanced up at the lintel, half expecting
to see inscribed there as over the gate to
Dante's Hell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">ALL HOPE ABANDON, YE WHO ENTER HERE!</p></div>

<p>At the rate our enlisted men were dying at Danville
and Salisbury during the winter of 1864-65,
all would have passed away in a few months, certainly
in less than a year; <span class="smcapl">AND THEY KNEW IT</span>.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that some of them, believing
our government had abandoned them to starvation
rather than again risk its popularity by
resorting to conscription for the enrollment of
recruits and by possibly stirring up draft riots
such as had cost more than a thousand lives in the
city of New York in July, 1863, accepted at last
the terms which the Confederates constantly held
out to them, took the oath of allegiance to the
Confederacy, and enlisted in the rebel army? I was
credibly informed that more than forty did it in
Prison No. Four at Danville, and more than eleven
hundred at Salisbury. Confederate recruiting officers
and sergeants were busy in those prisons,
offering them the choice between death and life.
No doubt multitudes so enlisted under the Confederate
flag with full determination to desert to
our lines at the first convenient opportunity.
Such was the case with private J. J. Lloyd, Co.
A, of my battalion, who rejoined us in North
Carolina. <i>The great majority chose to die.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The last communication that I received from
enlisted men of my battalion, fellow prisoners with
me at Salisbury, whom I had exhorted not to
accept the offers of the Confederates, but to be
true to their country and their flag, read thus:
"Colonel, don't be discouraged. Our boys all
say they'll starve to death in prison sooner than
take the oath of allegiance to the Confederacy."
And true to this resolve did indeed starve or freeze
to death Sergeant Welch, Sergeant Twichell,
Privates Vogel, Plaum, Barnes, Geise, Andrews,
Bishop, Weldon, who had stood by me in many a
battle, and who died at last for the cause they
loved.</p>

<p>It is comparatively easy to face death in battle.
No great courage or merit in that. The soldier
is swept along with the mass. Often he cannot
shirk if he would. The chances usually are that
he will come out alive. He may be inspired with
heroism,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In foeman worthy of their steel.<br /></span>

<p class="noin">There is a consciousness of irresistible strength

<p class="noin">Or nobler, he feels that he represents a nation or
a grand cause, and that upon his arm depends
victory. In his enthusiasm he even fancies himself
a vicegerent of the Almighty, commissioned
to fight in His cause, to work His will, to save His
earth from becoming a hell. "From the heights
of yonder pyramids," said Napoleon to the French
battling against the Mamelukes, "forty centuries
are looking down upon you." Our soldier in
battle imagined the world looking on, that for
him there was fame undying; should he fall
wounded, his comrades would gently care for
him; if slain, his country's flag would be his
shroud.</p>

<p>By no such considerations were our imprisoned
comrades cheered. Not in the glorious rush and
shock of battle; not in hope of victory or fadeless
laurels; no angel charities, or parting kiss, or
sympathetic voice bidding the soul look heavenward
while the eye was growing dim; no dear
star-spangled banner for a winding sheet. But
wrapped in rags; unseen, unnoticed, dying by
inches, in the cold, in the darkness, often in
rain or sleet, houseless, homeless, friendless, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
hard floor or the bare ground, starving, freezing,
broken-hearted.</p>

<p class="noin">It swept them away at Salisbury by tens, twenties,
even fifties in a single night.</p>

<p>These men preferred death to dishonor. When
we are told that our people are not patriotic, or
sigh of America as Burke did of France a century
and a quarter ago, that the age of chivalry is gone,
we may point to this great martyrdom, the brightest
painting on the darkest background in all our
history&mdash;thousands choosing to die for the
country which seemed to disown them!</p>

<p>My diary records, and I believe it correct, that
on the 17th of February, there were ten deaths
in the Danville prisons. A little before midnight
of that day the Danville prisoners were loaded
into box cars, and the train was started for Richmond.
Three, it was reported, died in the cars
that night, and one next morning in the street on
the way to Libby.</p>

<p>During the next three days I obtained the
autographs of two hundred and fifteen of my
fellow officers there. The little book is precious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

<p>On the twenty-second we were taken for exchange
down the James. As we passed through
the lines into what we were accustomed fondly to
call "God's Country," salvos of artillery and signs
of universal rejoicing greeted us. Our reception
made us imagine for an hour that our arrival
perceptibly heightened the general joy of the
Washington anniversary. But many of us could
not help wishing we were asleep with the thousands
who were filling nameless graves at Danville
and Salisbury.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class="block2"><p>Results and Reflections&mdash;The Right and the Wrong of it All.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days of waiting in the buildings of the
Naval Academy at Annapolis while exchange
papers were preparing gave us opportunity for a
much-needed transformation. Our old clothing,
encrusted with dirt and infested with vermin,
in many cases had to be destroyed. One of our
number especially unkempt, Captain T., who gave
up for an hour or two his beloved trousers, found
to his surprise and horror when he called for their
return that they had been burned with four hundred
dollars in greenbacks sewed up in the lining!
We smiled at his irrepressible grief; it was poetic
justice. He had carefully concealed the fact of
his being flush, pretending all along to be like
the rest <i>in forma pauperis</i>, and contriving, it was
said, to transfer in crooked ways our pennies into
his pockets!</p>

<p>Fumigated, parboiled, scrubbed, barbered, decently
clothed, "the deformed transformed" were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
once more presentable in civilized society. Then
followed a brief leave of absence if desired, to visit
relatives. To them it seemed a veritable resurrection
after our months of living burial; yet the
joy of reunion was sometimes tinged with sorrow.
I learned that in the very week in which the tidings
of my capture came our home circle had been
sadly broken by the death of a beloved sister, and
just then the telegraph told of the loss by fever
in the army at Newbern of our household
darling,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Younger by fifteen years than myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother at once and son.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As previously stated we who held commissions
fared better on the whole than the non-commissioned
officers and privates, though receiving
from the commissary rations exactly equal to
theirs. Commonly older and therefore of larger
experience and superior intelligence, a good
officer is as a father looking out for the physical
welfare of his men as well as himself. Then there
were some who, like Gardner, had been fortunate
in keeping clothing, money, or other valuable at the
instant of capture or in hiding it when searched by
Dick Turpin at Libby. Several like Captain Cook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had obtained pecuniary assistance from influential
friends across the lines, or in a few instances had
been favored by brother freemasons or by charitably
disposed visitors who gave us a little food, a
few old books, or even Confederate currency.
Several sold to the sentinels watches, rings, chains,
breast-pins, society badges, silver spurs, military
boots, or curiously wrought specimens of Yankee
ingenuity carved with infinite pains. The "Johnnies"
appeared to hanker for any article not produced
in the Confederacy. An officer of the
guard offered Putnam three hundred dollars for
a nearly worn-out tooth-brush!</p>

<p>The educational standard among our officers
was quite respectable. I think that West Point
had a representative among us, as well as Bowdoin
and several other colleges. Certainly we had
ex-students from at least five universities, Brown,
Yale, Harvard, the Sorbonne, and G&ouml;ttingen.</p>

<p>To afford diversion and as an antidote to depression,
as well as for intellectual improvement, some
of us studied mathematics<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> or <i>Shakespeare</i>. Three
or four classes were formed in modern languages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
We had card-playing with packs soiled and worn;
checkers and chess on extemporized boards with
rudely whittled "pieces"; occasional discussions
historical, literary, political, or religious; many
of us quite regular physical exercises in brisk
walks on the empty lowest floor; story-telling;
at times, though not often, the reading aloud of
a Confederate newspaper, to a group of fifty or
more listeners; at evening, sweet singing, riddles,
jests, or loud-voiced sarcastic conundrums and
satirical responses. Many found interest and
pleasure in carving with the utmost nicety wood
or bone.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Something like military discipline prevailed
among the two hundred in the upper room where
the superior rank of General Hayes was often
recognized. Among a hundred and fifty or more
in the lower room, where for a month or two I
was the senior but was unwilling to assume precedence,
I secured with the aid of Major Byron,
Captain Howe, and a few others a sort of civil
government with semi-military features.</p>

<p>These measures and the favoring circumstances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that have been mentioned tended of course to
the preservation of health among the officers.
There was severe suffering from hunger, cold,
rheumatism, and scurvy, from all of which I was
for weeks a victim and at one time seemed doomed
to perish. I recall, however, the names of but two
officers (there were said to be four) who died at
Danville. Some of us, though enfeebled, were
soon able to rejoin our commands; as Putnam
his at Newbern in April, Gardner and I ours at
Morehead City the day after Lee's surrender at
Appomattox.</p>

<p>Of the effect in after-life of these strange experiences
it is safe to say that to some extent they were
a spur to intellectual effort. At least they should
have made all sadder and wiser; and they certainly
were in some cases an equipment for descriptive
authorship. Major (Adner A.) Small wrote a valuable
account of prison life. Dr. Burrage's narratives
of his capture and its results are entertaining
and instructive. Major Putnam's <i>A Prisoner of
War in Virginia</i> (reprinted in his <i>Memories of My
Youth</i>) is an important contribution to our military
history.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Lieutenant Estabrooks's <i>Adrift in Dixie</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>

James A. Clark, 17th Pa. Cav.), one of the four
who nightly tried to sleep under my blanket, started
and edited with ability at Scranton <i>The Public
Code</i>, for which I was glad to furnish literary
material. He afterwards became prominent in
theosophic circles. Others distinguished themselves.
Captain (Frank H.) Mason, in prison our
best chess player, was long Consul-General at
Paris. Cook studied five or six years in Germany,
France, and Italy, then was for eight or ten years
assistant professor in German at Harvard, and
afterwards for two years, until his untimely death,
professor in the same department at the Institute
of Technology in Boston. In addressing a
Sunday-school in Brooklyn, 1871, I unexpectedly
lighted upon Captain Tiemann doing good work
as a teacher. Captain Gardner continued for
many months a model military officer in Georgia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
I remained in the service a full year, often on courts-martial,
military commissions, and "reconstruction"
duty.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>As already described, the condition of the
enlisted men strongly contrasted with ours. The
Report of the Confederate Inspector of Prisons
now on file in the <i>War Records</i> of our government,
though the reports of his subordinate officers are
significantly missing, covers the few months next
preceding January, 1865. It sharply censures
the immediate prison authorities, stating, as
the result of the privations, that the deaths at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Danville were at the rate of about five per day!
I think they were more numerous in January and
February. None of my battalion were there, but
at Salisbury three-sevenths of them died in less
than three months!</p>

<p>It is hard to refrain from the expression of
passionate indignation at the treatment accorded
to our non-commissioned officers and privates
in those southern hells. For years we were
accustomed to ask, "In what military prison of
the north, in what common jail of Europe, in
what dungeon of the civilized or savage world,
have captives taken in war&mdash;nay, condemned
criminals&mdash;been systematically exposed to a lingering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
death by cold and hunger? The foulest felon&mdash;his
soul black with sacrilege, his hands reeking
with parricide&mdash;has enough of food, of clothing, of
shelter; a chair to sit in, a fire to warm him, a
blanket to hide his nakedness, a bed of straw to
die on!"</p>

<p>But listen a moment to the other side. Alexander
H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy,
afterwards for eight years a representative
in our Congress, a man of unquestioned integrity,
shows in his <i>War between the States</i> (pub. 1868-70)
by quotation from the Report of our then
Secretary of War (July 19, 1866) that only 22,576
Federal prisoners died in Confederate hands
during the war, whilst 26,436 Confederate prisoners
died in Federal hands. He shows also from
the United States Surgeon-General Joseph K.
Barnes's Report that the number of Federal
prisoners in southern prisons was about 270,000,
but the number of Confederate prisoners in northern
prisons was about 220,000; so that the percentage
of deaths in southern prisons was under
nine, while the percentage of deaths in northern
prisons was over twelve!<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<p>Had there been, from the first, prompt exchanges
of prisoners between the north and the south, few
of these forty-nine thousand lives would have
been lost. <i>Who, then, blocked the exchange?</i></p>

<p>Stephens declares (<i>War between the States</i>, vol.
ii):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="inde">"It is now well understood to have been a part of the
settled policy of the Washington authorities in conducting
the war, not to exchange prisoners. The
grounds upon which this extraordinary course was
adopted were, that it was humanity to the northern
men in the field to let their captured comrades perish
in prison rather than to let an equal number of Confederate
soldiers be released on exchange to meet them
in battle."</p></div>

<p>To the same effect our Secretary Stanton in one
of his letters in 1864 pointed out "that it would
not be good policy to send back to be placed on the
firing line 70,000 able-bodied Confederates, and
to receive in exchange men who, with but few
exceptions, were not strong enough to hold their
muskets."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The responsibility, then, for this refusal and the
consequent enormous sacrifice of life with all the
accompanying miseries, must rest in part upon
the Government of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Blame not the tender-hearted Lincoln for this.</p>

<p>Did he not judge wisely? Was it not best for
the nation that we prisoners should starve and
freeze?</p>

<p>The pivotal question for him and Grant and
Stanton was, "Shall we exchange and thereby
enable the South to reinforce their armies with
fifty to a hundred thousand trained soldiers?</p>

<p>"If yes, then we must draft many more than
that; for they being on the defensive we must
outnumber them in battle. If no, then we must
either stop their cruelties by equally cruel retaliation,
as Washington hung Andr&eacute; for the execution
of Hale, or we must, more cruelly still, leave
myriads of our soldiers to sink into imbecility and
death."</p>

<p>The North had not the excuse of destitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
which the South had, and it could not bring itself
to make reprisals in kind. To draft again, as
evinced in the terrible riots of July, 1863, would
have been extremely unpopular and perhaps
overthrown the administration and defeated the
policy of the government. To exchange would
pretty surely have prolonged the war, and might
have resulted in permanent disunion.</p>

<p>As to the right or wrong of the refusal to exchange,
it is hardly relevant to insist that the
triumph of the South would have perpetuated
slavery. Lincoln's Proclamation, January 1, 1863,
did not touch slavery in the Border States. And
from the southern nation, denuded of slaves by
their escape to the North and confronted by the
growing anti-slavery sentiment of the civilized
world, the "peculiar institution" would soon
have died out.</p>

<p>Need we attempt, as is often done, to justify
our government's attitude in this matter by
affirming that the nation was in a life-and-death
struggle for its very existence? Did that existence
depend upon its territorial limits? Would it
have gone to pieces if the victorious North had
relinquished its hold on the defeated South? Had
a boundary line been drawn half-way across the
continent, separating the twenty-three loyal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
States from the eleven seceding, the twenty-two
millions of the North from the nine or ten millions
of the South, would it not have remained a mighty
nation with no cause for further disunion, and able
as the war had shown to place in the field more
than two million fighting men?</p>

<p>Is it not equally unnecessary to urge, as if it
were a valid excuse for our government's refusal
to exchange, that between the two nations there
would have been frequent if not perpetual hostilities?
Why so, any more than between the United
States and Canada, where for fifty (it is now a
hundred) years, along a boundary line of thirty-eight
hundred miles, there had been unbroken
peace and no fort nor warship?</p>

<p>Let us not raise the question whether Lincoln
made a colossal blunder when he renounced his
favorite doctrine so emphatically set forth in his
Congressional speech (page 47). The die was cast
when Sumter was fired on. The question which
confronted him in 1863-64&mdash;What to do with the
perishing Union prisoners?&mdash;was simply one of
military necessity.</p>

<p>According to the ethics of war was he not fully
justified in sacrificing us rather than imperiling
the great cause which he had at heart?</p>

<p>Are we, then, to blame President Davis, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Confederate Commissioner Robert Ould, or
Gen. John H. Winder, Superintendent of Military
Prisons, for allowing the Federal prisoners
to starve and freeze and die by thousands? Must
we not admit the truth of their contention that
their soldiers needed the food, clothing, and medical
care for want of which their prisoners were
suffering? And if the shocking conditions at Andersonville,
Salisbury, Danville, and other prisons
could easily have been avoided, or even if they
were made more distressing by the deliberate inhumanity
of those in immediate charge, ought
not such facts to have intensified a desire on
the part of both governments to effect a speedy
exchange?</p>

<p>The southern people were threatened with subjugation,
their government with annihilation.
In such a critical situation, what measures are
allowable?</p>

<p>We endeavor to look at the matter from both
standpoints.</p>

<p>This brings up the whole question of the rightfulness
of war. If it must be waged, is success
the highest duty? If military necessity demands,
may any and every law of God and man be disregarded?</p>

<p>While we write these concluding pages, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
European conflict is raging, and the voice of the
most warlike nation on the globe is heard continually
affirming that war is useful and highly honorable,
and that any means, however frightful, if necessary
to ensure or hasten victory is praise-worthy!</p>

<p>Then both presidents were right!</p>

<p>But is not international war murder on a great
scale? It is glorious to die for one's country; but
how about killing for our country? killing innocent
men, too? for the soldiers on either side
honestly believe they are doing their duty in shooting
and stabbing as many as possible! "The
business of war," said John Wesley, "is the business
of devils." So it would seem; but at heart few
are enemies, none devils.</p>

<p>It has been a pleasure in this narrative to record
instances of a very different spirit. Surely, in
proportion to population such were not fewer
in the South than in the North. Like Whittier's
<i>Angels of Buena Vista</i> they rescue us from pessimism.
They are prophetic of a better day.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> In my own case the prison experience was peculiar: it changed
the course of my whole subsequent life. I had studied law, been
admitted to the bar in two states, and "practiced" with fair success,
"though," as a friend was accustomed to remark, "not
enough to do much harm!" Many times one of the best men I
ever knew, my father, had said to me at parting, "Do all the good
you can." Much meditating while in the army and especially
while in prison, I finally resolved to pursue an educational career.
Of course I felt sadly the loss of years of study that might have
better equipped me; but it seemed a duty. I had had some
experience which, I thought, proved me not wholly unqualified.
While a student in college and while reading law I had
partly supported myself by giving instruction to private pupils
and in the schools of General Russell and Mayor Skinner. Afterwards,
before the war, I had taught Greek in the Worcester
(Mass.) Academy; and English literature, Greek, and Latin for
more than three years as principal of the Worcester public
high school. I knew the vocation would be congenial. So I
became principal of a state normal school, of two high schools,
of a large academy; house chairman of a (Conn.) legislative
committee securing the enactment of three school measures of
importance; later, president of a college, professor in a theological
seminary and in Cornell University; founder and for
three years first president of the earliest and long the largest
of the world's general <i>summer</i> schools (which now in the United
States number nearly 700); lecturer in many Chautauqua assemblies,
colleges, vacation schools, and university extension
centres; President of the State University of North Dakota;
editor, with biographic sketches and copious notes, of many
masterpieces as text-books in higher English literature; author
of a history of my regiment; also of a treatise on <i>Voice and
Gesture</i>, of many monographs and magazine articles mostly
educational; associate founder and first president of <i>The
Watch and Ward Society</i>; one of the directors and executive
committee of the <i>American Peace Society</i>; director of the <i>Massachusetts
Peace Society</i>; president of <i>The American Institute of
Instruction</i>; translator, annotator, and essayist of <i>The Book of
Job</i>; etc.
</p><p>
It may be proper to add that among those indebted in some
degree to my instruction or training were several who captured
Yale's highest prize for rhetorical excellence (the hundred dollar
gold medal of which I was the first recipient): one college president;
six college professors; three university presidents; two
governors of states; two United States Senators; and many others
eminent as clergymen, authors, judges, editors, and business
men.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The higher death-rate (if that be conceded) of southern
soldiers is easily accounted for. The northern soldiers had been
carefully selected by competent surgeons. They were physically
perfect, or nearly so. They were in the bloom of early manhood
or the strength of middle age&mdash;not an old man among them, not a
diseased man among them, not a broken-down constitution
among them. But multitudes of the southern, enrolled by conscription,
were physically unfit. Many were much too old or too
young. Said our General Grant, "To fill their ranks, they have
robbed the cradle and the grave!"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The exchange is said to have been stopped in 1862-63 by the
refusal of the Confederates to give up captured negro soldiers in
return for southern captives in the North, the United States
properly insisting upon perfect equality in the treatment of
black and white. But early in 1864, if not previously, the
Confederates yielded the point and were anxious to surrender
man for man.</p></div>

<p>The Court met pursuant to the foregoing order.
Present all the members. The Court then proceeded
to the trial of Capt. [we again omit the name of the
accused], 104th N. Y. Vols.</p>

<p>The Judge Advocate stated that he had acquainted
the accused of the order convening the Court, to
which he replied in the words following, to wit: "What
is that to do with me? I recognize no authority
in this prison to convene a court martial," or words
to that effect.</p>

<p>The accused having refused to appear, the members
of the Court were duly sworn by the Judge Advocate,
and the Judge Advocate was duly sworn by the President
of the Court. The accused, Capt. [again we
omit the name], 104th N. Y. Vols., was arraigned on
the following charges and specifications:</p>

<p>Charge&mdash;Conduct unbecoming an officer and a
gentleman.</p>

<p>Specification&mdash;In this: That Capt. [we again
omit], 104th N. Y. Vols., without provocation, did say
in the hearing of several officers to Lieut. Col. Homer
B. Sprague, 13th C. V., speaking in coarse and ungentlemanly
manner the words following, to wit: [here
we omit the language uttered as being too vile and
filthy to print]; that he did several times repeat
the same in a coarse and angry tone, and used other
vulgar and indecent expressions in an insulting tone
and manner. This at Danville Mil. Prison, Va.,
in the lower room thereof on the 29th day of October,
1864.</p>

<p>The accused refusing to appear, the Judge Advocate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was directed by the President to enter the plea of
Not Guilty.</p>

<p>Lieut. G. C. Wilson, 2d P. Artillery, and Lieut.
Wm. Shuler, 107th P. Vols., witnesses for the prosecution,
stated that they had cognizance of the facts
set forth in the Specification.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the Court having been reviewed
by the Judge Advocate, he submitted the case without
argument. The Court was then cleared for deliberation,
and having maturely considered the evidence
adduced find the accused</p>

<p>On the Specification, Guilty; with the exception of
the words "and used other vulgar and indecent
expressions."</p>

<p>Of the Charge, Guilty. And do therefore sentence
him to be reprimanded by the Senior Officer.</p>

<p>The Court is thus lenient owing to this being the
first case of the kind brought before it.</p>

<p>The Proceedings and Findings of the Court Martial
of which Lt. Col. W. A. Leach, 90th Pa. Vols., was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
President, having been submitted to Brig.-Gen.
Hayes, the Senior Officer present, are approved. The
extreme leniency of the Court must be apparent to all,
and can only be excused by the novelty of the case
brought before it. Language fails to convey censure
adequate to the gross vulgarity and ungentlemanly
conduct of the accused. Captain [we omit the name]
seems to forget or misconceive his responsibility in his
present circumstances. An officer being a prisoner
of war is not relieved from his responsibility to his
government nor from his liability to the regulations of
the service as far as may be applied to his dishonor by
ungentlemanly and unofficer-like conduct; and many
other offenses committed by an officer when a prisoner
of war are as punishable as if that officer were serving
with his command. And it is well the officers in the
prison have organized a Court for the summary punishment
of those of their number, who, forgetful of
their position and their honor, would bring shame
upon themselves and their associates.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that Capt. [name we omit]'s conduct
in the future will be such as will cause to be
forgotten his mistakes of the past.</p>
